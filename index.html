<p><strong>NOTICE: You may notice that you were redirected to GitHub, if you came using a Glitch link</strong></p>
<p><strong>I don't know if this site is an app on Glitch, but it's ending web-hosting for them on 8 July 2025. So I'm switching to GitHub for hosting my site. I might do an update on some social media accounts about moving to GitHub, and when/if the Glitch sub-site no longer works</strong></p>
<p>Hello! This is an index page. Are you looking for the directory?<br/>
Yeah whatever I don't care. Just, just go to a page</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> A lot of relative links won't work properly if the URL has "/" or "/index.html" at the end. That is about the silliest HTML behaviour I've seen - "/index.html" should really be implicit in any URL that doesn't end in a file. Anyway, if it does, remove it</p>

    <li>This page was blocked by the MalwareBytes Browser Guard extension apparently due to phishing, but <a href="https://e.widgetbot.io/channels/878924553290645535/878935620469280768">the embedded WidgetBot page</a> wasn't. So you can go there if you want</li>
    <ul><li><small>Always make sure you're on the right site before sending it your login information, and not an impostor one! And don't share information between sites, either. Also, this site is a static site, so there's no reason for you to login here</small></li></ul></ul>
  <li><a href="/my-ideas">My big list of ideas.</a> It's a very large page, though I think the GPTChats easily surpass it's length. Nonetheless, it will occupy you for quite a while I think</li>

I'm not as much of a fan of how it turned out as the original darker style, but you can use it if you want</p>-->

<p>21/5/2025 update: I'm back on Discord! (I spent a bit under a month trying to get my account back.) Now you can reach me there if you want</p>

<p>*Discord user info won't show the full bio. You'll have to see me on Discord for that</p>
<p>**The wiki just got closed. Good thing I backed it up! I'll have to reupload stuff somewhere.</p>
<p>***I'm currently blocked on there, though I'm still a bureaucrat there. I don't really care to return, although I have a few things in mind I want to do in quick succession if I unblock myself, like making blog pages for CLWVS stuff and something else if I remember</p>
<!--
<ol>
  <li>Remove myself from the AEWVS development/reception section</li>
  <li></li>
</ol>

<p>****Okay I looked at my profile in an incognito window and it just looks empty and kinda pointless. And where are my published chats?</p>
<p>*****Nothing on there is any good. I have two lousy repositories I posted on there that I only added because I broke my site on Glitch and I wanted to see if I could get all the apps on my laptop to do development from there, but it ran out of space　＼（－＿－）／</p>
