      <p>Here are all the features I want to add to Obliskate in the future.
        It's a mess, and it used to be on the main page but I finally decided to move it to it's own page.</p>
      <p>The stylesheet is also a bloody mess. I don't even</p>

          <li>
            Setting abilities required for tasks (with checkups, e.g. mental
            lucidity, physical energy)
          </li>
          <li>Setting privacy/publicity of profile/individual items</li>

              rely on other things to give you discipline (such as this program)
              to conserve mental stamina
            </li>
            <li>
              starting is harder than persisting so just push through it

            </li>
            <li>
              do not expect anything to become normal like just don't rely on

            <li>
              don't wait to do anything or you'll forget about it and never get
