      <p>Sigh.</p>
      <p>Can't believe we neded to do this, but, here we are.</p>
      <p>Okay, I thiiiiiiiiink I fixed it...</p>
      <p>Right, well, I guess my idea will kind of be, to, turn the list container into a flexbox, make the left one resizable, and make the right one occupy the remainder of the space</p>
      <p>
        Dunno how well that'd work but let's try
      </p>
      <p>
        Part of the motivation for making this is to just be able to centralise and cross-reference lists of items we need to have and items we need to buy more of with the task manager
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't think I'd be able to do much of anything if I don't make an all-in-one program for it. Like they did in China with that app they made. It'd just make everything way too Scattered and Lost and I need a reliable singular place to do everything, not a freaking modular one consisting of lots of apps from different people for different things I need to remember to use that might not have all the features I want
