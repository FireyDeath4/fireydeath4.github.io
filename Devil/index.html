==Description==
The Devil is a negative blue<ref>This is a colour with a negative output that makes black look like blue. Yes, it requires the absolute value of it to be negative since photons have no charge. So what?</ref> spirit taking the form of a part-European part-Cambodian human teenager with long brown hair and a light moustache that even he detests, as a result of procrastinating to use his shaver he brought pretty much a year ago on his last birthday. It has presumably made the awkwardness of being mistaken for a girl in public in his early years even worse (possibly including with current mask restrictions), and ruins the façade of preadolescence he intends to uphold for all his life, symbolising the immaturity and laziness of his being, as well as his aversion to change (the loss of former statuses and opportunities). He also has a terrible deep voice that makes him sound like a depressed teenager at this point, especially when he's tired.

He claims to be the most powerful being in Hell, but he is wrong. Although he has a narcissist's degree in philosophy (determined to be an objective score of around 96%) and a lot of experience with psychology, sprite battles and choreographic material, he is not cut out to interact with anyone apart from his abusers and his victims, as well as Jvest, and he is very submissive. In fact, the main way he copes with demanding people or situations is simply to cease all behaviour until he is left alone.

Despite this, he has unwittingly managed to unleash a second abominable fate upon the world, although it is lesser than the other.

Rather than an eldritch personification of all known evils, the Devil is rather an example of all the qualities an individual should not strive to have, save for a few other neutral or lacking qualities, and one redeeming quality. He is also very similar to Omori for many reasons.
==Personality==
He is a horrible, stuck-up, stubborn, inactive, lazy, pathetic, cowardly, possessive, retarded, autistic, sociopathic, immature and greedy biological neural network and wannabe. He's just an absolute doofus. We can't explain why. Oh wait, we can: he has [https://reddit.com/r/aspiememes autism.] Autistic people are the worst, because they do not have souls. We can prove this, because they are not good at socialising or associating with neurotypicals, which means they have Antisocial Personality Disorder, or ASPD (better known as sociopathy). Neurotypicals are also typical, making autists the "other". Also, recent studies have shown that 99.99999999999999% of people with good magical wellbeing can tell if the person in front of them is soulless within the first 60 minutes of meaningful conversation through their aura, even if it is encrypted by communicative means, such as online transmission. High-functioning autistic people consistently appear to be good people until they are considered an acquaintance to normal people.

He intends to take on the form of a 12 year old for the rest of his entire life (until he becomes a senior and it becomes unfeasible - or not). This will result in extremely expensive magical spells being cast to uphold that in future.

He is very logical, but the fact that the world has barely changed yet demonstrates how useless he is. He is currently still writing a wall of text to talk to a Christian he found on a random comment section on the internet.

He only likes the song Never Gonna Give You Up, Never Gonna Let You Down, Never Gonna Run Around And Desert You by Rick Astley because it's a funny prank, which shows that he has no respect, and also quickly demonstrates that he has no sense of love or relationship development. He has used it several times throughout the game.<ref>Examples: [[IT"S SATAN]], [[THICCOCHOCKERS]]</ref>

He doesn't like how niche concepts and areas of interest aren't popular to the point of major intersection with mainstream content, and generally intends to unify them, which shows that he does not respect the boundaries of others.

He has heard about virtually every single problem with modern meat production and fishing, including unethicality, suffering, disease mutation, pollution and climate change, but he still chooses to purchase cheap meat and animal products. Yet, he is too cowardly to kill his cats like he said he would some years ago. In fact, he is too cowardly to directly kill any animal larger than a non-huntsman spider, and he has even taken distaste to unintentionally stepping on Snails in his garden in the middle of the night since they make a mess. Many greedy choices he makes seem to be justified solely for the evulz to distance himself from the natural, subjective sense of morality he possesses.

He has attempted to stop feeling bad and fully embrace evil multiple times, but he has failed every single time as they are mutually exclusive, even abstaining to spray bug poison in his cats' faces and stabbing any individual (including a terrorist) before being caught by the mall's security guard and sent to the mental ward, repeatedly screaming abuse like a helpless mobster being detained while strapped to a stretcher in the ambulance on a day a few years ago. During that day, he even took the orange texter closest to red and tried to paint blood under his eyes like a creepypasta character. This should roughly demonstrate how conceivably cringy, embarrassing, retarded, desperate, emotionally and mentally unstable and impulsive he can be.

This is not even talking about the other negative relations he has created with many people, multiple times initiated with cringe. He has been banned from one subreddit, at least two Discord servers (one of which was the only one he really used) and at least three locations.
==Abilities==
*'''Pyrokinesis:''' This is his main magical ability, but as he is underage and has a low magical score, this has been illegally learnt. Also, according to astrology, he is a water sign, and virtually the only reason he values this ability is because he has ADHD, so he considers that it is exciting.

All other abilities are non-official; however his hands have a growing number of abilities taken from multiple sources when engaging in battles between them.
==Cringe Compilation==
'''NOTICE: Since there are children (particularly Scratch users) reading this, or generally just because it's...erm...uh...uhhh...look nobody should ever know about it. I mean he's the goddamn devil for Pete's sake. inappropriate events will be excluded or simplified.'''
*Decided two children were his friends and chose a favourite contestant on MasterChef in primary school based on their faces (since he hadn't trained enough to actually deduce any sensible factors), and gave them almost exclusive attention.
*Was oblivious to multiple values at an early age and proceeded to engage in many inappropriate events.
*Quoted multiple characters at incredibly specific situations without understanding what they meant.
*Acted in short films without cognising what the plans were or resisting ADHD hysteria in the face of big buildings after having spent lots of time preparing for them.
*Wrote at least six scripts that sucked, either by reflecting his nature and experiences or being incredibly unorganised and random.
*Directly referred to disgusting and appalling things while talking about them multiple times.
==Testimonies==
See the comment section of this page.
==Works==
*Various exclusively self-audient battle performances
*Various Scratch projects (link is in the infobox's appearance attribute)
*Multiple KCA short films
*Some unreleased GarageBand soundtracks
*AEwVS projects<ref>That's taboo, so we haven't linked it. He is definitely the Devil.</ref>
*Co-developer of [[Complicated Learning with Victoria Strobivska]]
*AEwVS: ABC
==Trivia==
*The Devil deliberately spells all instances of "its" with an apostrophe (when talking normally).
*The Devil's favourite Sonic game was ''Sonic '06''<ref>Now he just doesn't even partake in favouritism anymore. He used to say he was a fan of Dragon Ball Z just because he watched a sprite movie on YouTube about a Sonic/DBZ crossover.</ref> before he realised that anthropomorphism is no excuse for interspecies shipping, and also that shipping is just generally taboo. He has not actually seen (or at least remembered) very much of other Sonic games.
*The Devil opposes Christianity (and [https://www.youtube.com/c/TheraminTrees many other inane religions]), confirming his position. It also demonstrates that in spite of his acts of antiracism, antisexism and other oppositions of unmeaningful discriminations, he is judgmental and discriminating.

*'''THE DEVIL HAS DOOMED EVERYONE IN HIS IMMODESTY, BY MAKING THIS PAGE AND MANY OTHERS LONGER THAN THAT OF [[ABSOLUTE GOD]], TO YEETING INTO HIS BROTHER'S NAUGHTY HELL FILLED WITH KUGELBLITZ PITS OF BURNING HELL.''' <font color="#F00">'''ALL IS NOW FORSAKEN INTO TWO DIFFERENT CRISES.'''</font>


*'''HE DOES NOT TRULY HOLD THE [[THICCOCHOCKERS]] HE BROUGHT INTO BEING INTO HIS HEART, AS HE HAS FORGOTTEN THEM WITHOUT CONCERN. HE WILL NOT BE SAVED.''' AT THE END OF HIS MORTAL COIL, <font color="#F00">HE WILL DISAPPEAR FROM THE WORLD AND HIS HEART WILL COLLAPSE INTO AN INFINITE SINGULARITY, LEAVING ONLY HIS WRETCHED MISDEEDS BEHIND.</font>



*<font color="#F00"><big>'''''HELL IS REAL.'''''</big></font>



*'''Believe in the Thiccochockers to save your own soul.'''
*Alternatively, you may put faith in the Devil to see if he resolves the crises. You will become almost as bad as him by doing that, however. He's not a narcissist, but he believes in himself because he has to. You can also try to convince the [[Holy Trinity]] to make a new judgment that immediately resolves the crises, which could result in the abrupt, immediate end of the universe. If you don't succeed, you might render yourself permanently unsavable. If you want, you can just spend some of your time complaining about the Devil because frankly the odds are stacked overwhelmingly against you.
