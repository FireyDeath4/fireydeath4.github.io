Omniverse

Type: Space
Level: Omniversal
Position - Location: Monocosm (The Barrel), Paradox Space
Position - Contents: Depends on interpretation. When the archverse with index ω, an omniverse contains archverses with lower indices. When taken to be all of existence, it contains all things that exist.
Soupcount ordinal index: ω

The omniverse (or Omniverse) is the largest of the classical -verses, surpassing a multiverse or even any of the archverses by a transfinite factor. While frequently argued to contain absolutely everything, there are limits to the Omniverse's extent reached when one attempts to derive something not part of a given understanding of reality.

Information
The Omniverse holds everything that can be accessed through progressive powersets of any particular base universe (or "reality") within itself. It is the limit of archverse recursion - this can be the first limit ordinal ω, or a much higher transfinite, depending on the level of recursion considered.
In a sense, it can indeed be argued to contain "all of Reality", but only in the sense that those below it observe it to be as such. The inhabitants of a universe, for instance, can posit the existence of a multiverse containing every possible state their universe could be in, and a megaverse allowing for looser laws of physics, and a gigaverse allowing for even fewer restrictions, but the limit of this application must be at the omniverse if they wish to stay within the concept of "things that are real". Thus, alternate omniverses in each other's relative Paradox Space contain things that cannot be mapped from one sense of "reality" to another.
Not many entities or civilizations can achieve or even fathom exiting the Omniverse, either being denied access to the exterior by Creator or Destroyer, or simply not being advanced enough to jump through an infinite amount of spaces. However, it has been done by many highly advanced civilizations, and even some small teams, such as Satoru's crew.
The only trait every single thing within the Omniverse share is that it exists. How it exists varies in countless ways.
The term "omniverse" was coined by Mark Gruenwald. It has been popularized by the composer-writer Sun Ra. Roger Penrose has spoken of the "omnium".

Beyond the Omniverse
The Omniverse exists in the surrounding emptiness known as The Outside, a void of virtual nothingness. Whatever may lie outside of these concepts is simply referred to as Beyond, one of the many iterations contained by Transcendentem.
Two Godverses orbit the Omniverse, one belonging to Creator, and one to Destroyer.
The Omniverse, the three Godverses, and The Outside are what makeup the Barrel, the local monocosm.</pre>
