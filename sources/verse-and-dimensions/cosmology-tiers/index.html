Hypercosmologists' Interpretations of Cosmology Tiers

This is the Cosmology Tier page: here we rank the highest and the lowest -verses and other similar structures.
Multiple possible cosmologies exist thanks to the Law of Cosmological Subjectivity. Each one has its own section below.
Anybody who is authorized or is an administrator gets their own official section on this page, other than that, users can feel free to create their own blog posts.

Second Soup's increasingly messy cosmology
-The Box: Self-containing recursive extralogical concept that defeats most half-baked attempts to surpass it. Essentially defined as "containing all the things"; may or may not be the highest meaningfully arguable cosmological element. To be determined.
-Abfield: That which the schemafield does not encompass; in a vague sense, contains the objects that cannot be reached through information patterns and set theories at all. Contains multiple schemafields, higher ultimata, ultimata-surpassing hierarchies, and infinitely weirder things.
-Schemafield: A sort of operation-space dominant over generalization in the first place. Generalization from Prism Gates and such is one way to try to climb it, but arbitrary portions of it are sealed off to typical set theories and such.
-Limit of Prism Gate recursion falls somewhere up here, thanks to repeated abstraction over ultimata and their definitions.
-Metempiric space: Extracosmological zone not part of an altarca. No extent, no meaningful properties, nada.
-Altarca: Self contained mini-Boxes holding various cosmologies different than those seen below.
--The Barrelplex: This wiki's "local" altarca, containing the structure seen below, including the Barrel and its contents.
-Soupcount enumerates all the higher -verses past this point with various ordinals. Being rethought/reworked.
-Transcendentem: Mapped to level ω + 3. A form of higher-order nonspace holding beyond bubbles. Also forms bubbles of its own.
-Beyond: Mapped to level ω + 2. A form of higher-order nonspace holding monocosms. Wrapped into "bubbles" contained within larger structures.
-Monocosm: Mapped to level ω + 1. A self-contained pocket of Outside holding some quantity of large-scale -verses.
--The Barrel: The "local" monocosm used for most of the work on the wiki, unless otherwise specified. Contains an omniverse, two godverses, and the Outside in between them.
-The Outside: The extradimensional nonspace forming the region within the Barrel disconnected from the -verses below.
-Godverses: These two structures "orbit" the omniverse - one houses Creator, the other Destroyer.
-Omniverse: Mapped to level ω. First lodeverse (limit archverse). Infinitely high up in the archverse chain and is really more of a "direction" one approaches by counting... like ordinal ω.
-Archverse: Infinite group of -verses below. You can start counting them at 1 (universe) and then start going up from there.
-Megaverse: Infinite group of multiverses and specialized multiverses, like paraverses.
-Multiverse: Large finite, or infinite, group of universes and pocket universes, plus weird specialized ones.
-Past this you probably have a good handle on the rest.

Tonybalongna's Absolute Cosmology
-Nothing: &gt;X̴̩͖(͉̳͍̋̔ͪͬͧ$̷̫#̤̘͈͙̎ͭ̓̿͠%̷̟̖̬ͮ͛̓̊N̝̱͍͓!̜̼̯̫͕̇̿ͬ͂̓͒(̇̅*̼̝ͫ͑N͇̮ͧͩ̽$̲̝ͨͨ̍͆͌̃͆!̗͓̯S̻̭̣͎̗̹M̱͓͈̿͒̓̓̀ͭ(̵͔͎̄͊$̓̐Z̰̑̓N̘̩̘̂ͤ͆̀̒́!͎̬̜ͮ̅͊ͩ(̣͇͖̬$҉̟͚̣F͎ͯͦ́͋ (wrong; you're not fooling me with your Zalgo text Tony... obviously it's )
-The Box: The ultimatum of all existing and nonexistent altarcae. If you can, or can't think of something, it's in the box.
-Metempiric space: The area between altarcae with no properties.
-Altarca: Alternate cosmological routes leading up to the box. Some don't lead up to the box at all but instead are contained at an inaccessible barrier an infinite amount of distance away.
--The Barrelplex: The wiki's set of altarcae, however, this is an altarca itself.
-Transcendentem Continuum: Infinite set of Transcendentem-bubbles.
-Transcendentem: The sum of every beyond-bubble.
-Beyond: Contains a variable amount of omniverses and godverses. Beyond contains most altarcae, the altarcae that aren't contained are present in their own bubbles throughout Transcendentem.
-Monocosm: The name for any standard verse hierarchy leading up to Beyond, our local monocosm contains the omniverse, the two godverses, and beyond. This can vary, though, since there are an infinite number of monocosms in the box. Each monocosm can have different properties, leading different types of verses to be created within it, or even some verses not even being able to be born at all.
-Godverse: Home to Creator and Destroyer, there are two in most altarcae. The godverses don't contain any lower verses.
-Omniverse: Contains every archverse. Omniverses are cosmology transcendent, meaning that any laws of a smaller verse do not affect it at all. aleph null can be assigned to it.
-Ultraverse: Container of archverses, can still be contained by a larger archverse. (usually an archverse at 1,000,001+) Most ultraverses contain around 1,000,000 archverses. Ultraverses can be assigned to every millionth natural number.
-Archverse: Placeholder name for any verses above Megaverse. Each archverse can be assigned to a natural number.
-Megaverse: Contains many Multiverses, can have different properties leading to multiverses with different properties, leading to different types of laws inside of these multiverses, making their cosmologies different.
-Multiverse: Every possible outcome of one universe. Each outcome is located in a different universe within a multiverse, and some multiverses have completely new events aswell. Each multiverse created can have different properties, leading for different type of universes to be born.
-Universe: Hyper-cosmic bubble of an indefinite size containing several hyper-intergalactic structures. Some universes can expand, some don't. Some universes don't even have the opportunity to be born at all.
-Supercluster: Contains tens of thousands of galaxies
--Supergalaxy: End state of a supercluster when every galaxy in that supercluster has coalesced into one
-Galaxy cluster: Contains hundreds of galaxies
-Galaxy group: Contains dozens of galaxies
-Galaxy: Can contain up to 100 billion solar systems
-Solar System: Structure with at least 3 planets and 1 (possibly) habitable planet orbiting a large interstellar mass, usually a star, can be a Black hole.

Scoot's Degrading Cosmology
It's called a Degrading Cosmology not just because it gets worse and worse over time (though it definitely does) but because a key focus is that the higher up you go, the fewer laws apply to the sum of the lowest levels. (If that sounds confusing, all it means is that a random universe out of the Multiverse follows more of our universe's laws than a random universe out of the whole Box.)
It doesn't really have a "highest structure" or "upper bound" so just because a certain thing may be at the top of the list, that doesn't mean it's a supreme unbeatable unquestionable structure, it just happens to be the largest.
(It might be useful to read this from the bottom to the top instead of top to bottom.)
Maximal Tier:
-The Box: Contains everything and ignores anything that prevents it from doing so. It is in the Box, for any definition of "it".
-Cheesebox: Contains everything except one single cheeseburger and ignores anything that prevents it from doing so.
-Microbox: Contains anything that is local to us on a Boxial scale and ignores anything that prevents it from doing so.
Hypercosmological Tier:
-Deepfield: Contains everything that must inherently exist as a consequence of an object that contains everything, and ignores all paradoxes that prevent it from doing so.
-Disfield: Contains all possible extensions and exploitations of the Antifield and ignores anything that prevents it from doing so.
-Nonfield: Contains everything that isn't contained and ignores anything that prevents it from doing so.
-Parafields: Like n-aryfields, except instead of focusing on "is" and "isn't" it's "can be contained" and "can't be contained".
-Antifield: Contains everything that can't be contained and ignores anything that prevents it from doing so.
-Itfield: Contains everything. It is in the Itfield, for any definition of "it".
-Ennoifield: Contains all concepts.
-Abfield: Contains everything with no information at all.
-Schemafield: Contains all information and all manipulations of information.
-Platofield: Contains all n-aryfields.
-Prismfield: Contains everything output-able by a Prism Gate.
-n-aryfields: Extensions of the Binaryfield and Trinaryfield where 'n' is the number of options. (For example, Binaryfield is 2-aryfield, Trinaryfield is 3-aryfield.) 'n' can be any number, including infinities and post-infinities.
-Trinaryfield: Contains everything that either is a potato, isn't a potato or neither. (Potato is arbitrary.)
-Binaryfield:Contains everything that either is or isn't a potato. (Potato is arbitrary)
-Maiorverse: Contains all Selfverses.
-Selfverses: Cosmological structures that are larger than themselves and/or contain more than they themselves contain.
Pre-Barrelplexial Tier:
-Barrelplex: Our local Altarca, and the end of the Archverse chain.
-Nonexistence: A realm beyond standard human thought where the logic we know does not apply.
-Mathverse: The Archverse that contains everything that follows the laws of mathematics.
-The Secode: The Archverse which is to the Omniverse as the Omniverse is to our universe. (Soupcount value of ω*2.)
-Transcendentem: An Archverse made of pure Trosinium with a Soupcount value of ω+3.
--Beyond Bubble: An area of Transcendentem with low informational density. Functions as a hospitable Archverse with a Soupcount value of ω+2.
--Beyond Singularity: An area of Transcendentem with high informational density. Functions as an inhospitable Archverse with a Soupcount value of ω+2.
-Monocosm: The Archverse directly following Omniverse, often (though not always) containing one Omniverse and three Godverses. (Soupcount value of ω+1.)
-Omniverse: The Archverse that contains everything that abides by basic scientific ideas such as dimensions and quantum physics. Many civilisations struggle to go beyond this point so it is often considered to be all of existence. (Soupcount value of ω.)
--Godverse: A specialized Omniverse created by and controlled by a Monocosmic God.
-Archverses: Each Archverse contains an infinite number of the previous Archverse. Each Archverse has one thing which all of their universes have in common, and the Archverse after that one does not have this in common, however it has another feature they all share, which is removed at the next level. Thus, the more abstract a feature is, the larger its corresponding Archverse will be. (The laws of physics are very real while the laws of mathematics are very abstract, so the Mathverse will be larger than the Megaverse.)
-Megaverse: Contains an infinite number of Multiverses which all have different laws of physics but all share the same fundamental particles.
-Multiverse: Contains an infinite number of universes which all share the same laws of physics.
-Universe: Contains an infinite amount of 3-dimensional space and 1-dimensional time.
Sub-Physical Tier:
-Voids: Common denominators of fields and -verses. (For example, Megavoid is contained by everything within the Megaverse.)
-Metabyte: Unit of measurement for modelling small pieces of abstract information.
-Quantum: Unit of measurement similar to Metabytes with far less detail, allowing it to model the entire Schemafield.
-Sergeconcept: The most basic and fundamental concepts in existence, more complex concepts are collections of Sergeconcepts.
-Nihil: Complete lack of anything according to a particular definition of 'everything'. (Such as, for example, "all tangible things", "all information" or "all concepts".)
-Sergeconnection: Collections of Sergepoints that connect Non-Concepts together to make concepts.
-Non-Concepts: Loose collections of Sergepoints.
-Sergepoint: The Most basic unit in all existence and nonexistence. It can be broken down into Sergepoints, for any definition of "it".
-Nothing:⠀⠀⠀⠀

ThisWriter's Cosmology
It pretends to contain the not so humble properties of being coherent with what we intuit, believe, feel and seem to observe about our reality as well as to be able to include any and all fantasy at the same time while being able to relate them to each other and maintain a measure of coherence. In other words, it tries to point out the obvious using made up and important looking words.
Basic or Top Level concepts or elements, also known as ThisWriter's Top Cosmology
-Omniumverse - The set of our real cosmology plus all of the fantasy
-Realium - Our own reality and whatever cosmology it is part of (could be just our single universe)
-Imaginarium - All of fantasy including all invented cosmologies and such (like those listed on this page)
-Great Barrier - The border between reality and fantasy
-Imaginatas - Each Imaginata is an imagined or believed reality inside the Imaginarium which can have its own Cosmology
-Cosmology - It is the name given to the large scale organizing structure of both the Realium and any Imaginata, usually taking some hierarchical form but not necessarily

The Law of Cosmological Subjectivity

This wikia's cosmologies are entirely subjective; they all exist simultaneously, regardless of logical structure.
And that's about it.
If you want a constant stack of ever-more-abstract structures ascending past imagination and reason, go for it. If you want the Box to be the highest level, you can stop there. If you want the Omniverse to be the highest level, you can stop there. If you want the universe (ours) to be the only -verse that actually exists, you can do that.
We do try to share our cosmologies to some extent on this wiki, but if there are contradictions, you're free to branch off and make your own little world.</pre>
