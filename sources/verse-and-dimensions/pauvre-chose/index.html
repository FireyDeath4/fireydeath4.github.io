Pauvre Chose

Aliases: Powerless Entity, Ungod, Impotence
Occupation/goals: None
Powers: None*

Pauvre Chose is the name given to an entity in hypercosmology, described as an entity that can't do any task regardless of any contradictions that would occur from it holding properties that lead to any, and could not learn or grow to do does tasks. These tasks can be anything from over taking a universe, to thinking, to anything else, if it has a definition, categorization, or interpretation in any possible, impossible, and imaginable form(s), it is not a task Pauvre Chose can do. It is the embodiment of isolated meaningless and impotence.
In sense, it is the exact opposite of The True God.

Description
It is, by definition, infinitely impotent, unable of almost anything and only has just enough self-awareness for its potency to be worthy of measurement, this means Pauvre Chose may be able to have littlest form of consciousness. It doesn’t have a tangible form, instead it is merely a concept. One could say that Pauvre Chose at the end of a meta-fictional chain, which could be interpreted as:
“The character beneath me said: “The character beneath me said: “The character beneath me said: “The character benea…”
and ending with a “The character beneath me said: “There is character beneath me that is the very definition of isolated meaningless and impotence.”
Then there's an endless number of parallel universes, in which, every concept spawns a pocket universe. This repetition of self-containing continues infinitely, until you find a tactile version of Pauvre Chose.
This raises the question if Pauvre Chose exists inside of The Antibox, many of the same arguments can used from if The True God exists outside The Box, only reversed for Impotent, however, there is the argument that if Pauvre Chose exists inside The Antibox, then it can complete the task of overriding The Antibox's definition, though if this can be counted as a task is debated

Contradictions
It is unable to do anything, including learning and growing, this however can bring many contradictions, one of which is the fact that Pauvre Chose can complete the task of being unable to overcome a force of entity's power to make it grow. Most of these can be resolved if Pauvre Chose's definition overriding another's does not count as a task, however, there are other ways to solve it.
Creation Contradiction
Pauvre Chose is created by an author. But if an author could create Pauvre Chose and give its cosmology, then the author could also change its power, thus, defeating its purpose. It could be possible that author authority is superior to Pauvre Chose's Impotence, which would make the most sense, but that would imply that it is stronger than True Omnipotence and can override The Box's definition.
However, Pauvre Chose could also just be a biproduct of an object or force, but that would mean that there would have to be a force as weak or weaker than Pauvre Chose, otherwise it would be too powerful to create one, but if it is weaker, then it would defeat Pauvre Chose's "purpose", and if it was the same strength, then the only "thing" of that power would be another Pauvre Chose, meaning it can do a task, which is impossible.
True God Contradiction
If The True God has the ability to do any task regardless of any contradictions that would occur from it holding properties that lead to any, then could they put Pauvre Chose out of its powerlessness? Both have same level of overriding other's contradictions. It could be said that True Omnipotence is more powerful than Impotence since its well, Impotence, and if it was able to override True Omnipotence, then beings of Impotence can do one task, which is to override the ability to grow.</pre>
