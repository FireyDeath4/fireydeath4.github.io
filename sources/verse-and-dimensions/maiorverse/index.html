The Maiorverse

Type: Selfverse
Level: Low Hyper-cosmological
Inhabitants: Many types, both of static power and power greater than itself
Position - Location: Binaryfield
Position - Contents: Selfverses
Soupcount ordinal index: âˆžALL (Limit of Soupcount)

The Maiorverse contains all Selfverses that gain their full size solely by being larger than themselves to some extent. If the size of a Selfverse is dependent on how much larger than itself it is, then that Selfverse is within the Maiorverse. No Selfverse can become larger than or in any way surpass the Maiorverse simply by being larger than itself, to do so it must have other properties defining how much it contains. The Maiorverse's name is based on the word 'Maior' from Latin, meaning "greater than".

Clarification
While it is technically true that -verses such as the Schemafield, Binaryfield and the Box are Selfverses, a distinction should be made between -verses such as those and standard Selfverses. None of the above -verses gain their full size via being larger than themselves, rather that is effectively trivia. Instead, they use other axioms to gain their size.
For example, if a -verse has no definition other than that it contains itself to a significant extent, no matter how great that extent is it will never contain every single thing that can be expressed as information as there are many things which can be expressed as information beyond any -verse that is solely greater than itself to any extent. Equally, no -verse can contain every object 'y' which is either object 'x' or not object 'x' simply by being larger than itself.
The above mentioned -verses contain more than any plain Selfverse could ever contain (a plain Selfverse being a Selfverse with no properties other than being larger than itself to some extent), no matter what that extent is as the above mentioned -verses have other axioms besides their size in relation to itself. As such, a distinction should be made between -verses that gain their full size from being Selfverses (plain Selfverses) and -verses that gain their size via other axioms and are Selfverses by coincidence.
This is the purpose of the Maiorverse. All plain Selfverses are within the Maiorverse, and all -verses larger than the Maiorverse have axioms that allow them to contain more than any plain Selfverse ever could.
Note that the Maiorverse does not just contain naive extensions of the first Selfverses. -Verses which are larger than any naive extension of the first Selfverse could ever be are still within the Maiorverse so long as it gains its size solely from being a Selfverse.

Beyond the Maiorverse
The Maiorverse can be considered the limit of low-level Hypercosmology. Past this point, -verses get increasingly broad and encompass huge amounts of objects and concepts, to such an extent that often many standard Hypercosmological -verses could be confused for a structure such as the Box that contains everything. This is because it is often difficult to imagine the kind of concepts which would be larger than a particular Hypercosmological structure and as such it is assumed that none exist.</pre>
