The Antibox

Type: Hypercosmological structure
Level: Sometimes taken to be very small or minimal
Position - Location: In everything
Position - Contents: Other than itself, unknown
Size - Dimensionality: Inapplicable
Holomanga's unreality level: ∞ (projectively extended surreal number; debatable)
Holomanga's surreal verse level: -∞ (affinely extended surreal number; debatable)

The Antibox is the cosmological object that is contained by everything. Regardless of internal properties, the Antibox is in it, for any value of "it".
In a sense, it is an opposite of the Box, though in a different one than an object that contains nothing (an empty set). Like the Box and other hypercosmological structures, the Antibox contains itself and is not wellfounded. As it is inside everything, it is, in a sense, an omnipresent object though it does not necessarily have other properties such as omnicapacity (which Box-equivalent structures have) or omnipotence (which the True God has).
Unlike the empty set, the definition of the Antibox given above does not automatically imply that it is a small object or even the smallest object containmentwise. The Antibox is still completely capable of containing objects, it would just be also contained within those objects. Of course, one can take the Antibox to be an object that does not contain any other objects within it (other than itself) and consider it to be very small—the definition of the Antibox does not state anything about any other objects and their relation to the Antibox so it is reasonable to assume so. Equally, it is also reasonable to assume that there are other non-Antibox things inside the Antibox. One interesting case would be a Box-equivalent structure.

Positions on Scales
On a surreal verse level system that uses the class of affinely extended surreal numbers rather than the class of projectively extended surreal numbers, one that considers the Antibox to be minimal can place the Antibox at −∞, the affine infinity less than all surreal numbers, while the Box is at +∞. This is to ensure that the Antibox has the smallest index and the Box has the largest index and that the former is contained by and the latter contains everything regardless of how simple or complicated any indexed structure is (the birthday of the surreal number doesn't matter, −∞ and +∞).
On Holomanga's Unreality Scale, the Antibox can be considered to have an equal "unreality" with the Box. This places it at the projective ∞ in the class of projectively extended surreal numbers.</pre>
