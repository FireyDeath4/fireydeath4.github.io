Universe

Level: Universal
Inhabitants: Could be many, could be none, could be some
Position - Location: Multiverse
Position - Contents: Supercluster Complex/Turtlies
Size/scale/dimensionality properties: Variable

A universe can be interpreted as a -verse that comprises of a self-contained spacetime that can be of any shape (e.g. hyperspherical, flat, hyperbolic) and all of the contents within it. Contents of a universe can include, but are not limited to, planets, brown dwarfs, stars, galaxies, dark matter, dark energy, other forms of mass-energy, and even civilizations of entities. Space-times and their own contents disconnected from and causally independent from that of a given universe are typically called parallel to said universe. Finite or infinite sets of universes with some given relationship with one another are known as multiverses.
Universes can host restrictions on how objects within it can behave and interact with one another. These restrictions are known as the universe's laws of physics. Scientific progression by intelligent civilizations living within a universe involves the development of scientific theories that aim to accurately reflect physical relationships fundamental to universal laws.
Universes of finite age can start from an initial, generally extremely hot and dense, state known as a Big Bang from which it will "age" and expand from. Events that take place "before" a universe's Big Bang are generally not particularly meaningful to entities embedded within the universe as they are not part of the universe's spacetime. Depending on factors such as energy density, curvature, size, and topology, a universe can have many different expansion behaviors and end states. Examples of possible end states that can occur to an expanding universe include a Big Crunch, a Big Rip, and heat death.
Alternatively, a universe can refer to everything that can be observed by a given reference entity. Our observable universe, for instance, is the set of all possible things within our own universe such that electromagnetic radiation potentially from said things has had enough time within the age of the universe to reach the planet Earth.


Interpretations
Different interpretations of a multiverse containing multiple universes whether they are different structures often considered a multiverse by people or differing interpretations of a multiverse in different cosmologies can involve different interpretations of what a universe is and how they're structured. These interpretations can vary wildly in size and structure.
A Type I multiverse, interpreted as an infinite, isotropic, and homogeneous universe itself, contains multiple observable universe-sized region of spaces identical to that of a given observable universe spaced apart by
10^10^115 meters that are interpreted as parallel universes.
When the (10+1)D universe of M-theory is interpreted as a multiverse, the (3+1)D Dirichlet membranes (D3-branes) that can have observable universes embedded in them can be interpreted as universes.

Multiverses
Most universes are born from a multiverse in which there are multiple to perhaps an immeasurable number - which may or may not contain humans or life at all. In fact, some of them may be so hostile that chemistry or physics as we know them do not function properly.

Other information
Travel between universes is possible for extremely advanced civilizations through the use of portals, dark energy, time maneuvering, or other space-warping mechanisms. Additionally, cosmic entities can traverse through universes easily. Most universes shall eventually "die" as the second law of thermodynamics ensures that energy becomes less and less usable over time. This may not always be the case with alternate physical laws, though.
A universe can have any amount of dimensions from 1 to Aleph-one.

Types of Universes
Due to special properties a universe can have, it may be categorized differently from most since it's not just the laws of physics and possibilities that are different.
Multiversally bounded
These are universes that are born in multiverses, born from big bangs. These are the most likely to give birth to powerful civilizations since they are more safe and less bounded than other types of universes.
Soverses
Soverses is any "-verse" on the Archverse chain that isn't contained by the verse on the nested level above it. An example would be a universe not being contained by a local 5-dimensional multiverse, or a Megaverse not being contained by any Gigaverse or Teraverse. Any "-verse" on the Archverse chain can be as a Soverse, but it is most common for universes, as they are generally the lowest and most basic unit of "verses". Any civilization that emerges in a Soverse will struggle to climb higher than Type IV on the Kardashev scale (Or whatever level is associated with the verse that is a Soverse), as they would need a higher jump in dimensional travel (Ex: a civilization born in a universe that isn't contained with a will have to advance to 6th dimensional travel before arriving in another universe)
Innaturalis
Latin for "unnatural" any universe falling into this category is created by an advanced civilization or cosmic entity. They are not born from big bangs and are usually unnaturally organized and/or have properties meant to create and/or keep certain things. If a universe falls into this category, it could still be categorized as Multiversally bounded or Soverse.
Pocket Universe
These are universes in which they come from a host universe; they are pockets of physics and possibilities different from the original universe but is not different enough to break free from it whether in space or time. They often confused with parallel universes because they are slight changes in possibility and laws of physics, but if they still exist in the same timeline or the smaller universe is still inside of the larger, than it is a pocket universe.</pre>
