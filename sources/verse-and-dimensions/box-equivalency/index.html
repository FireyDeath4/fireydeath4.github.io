The Law of Box Equivalency

This law states that any possible new structure anyone comes up with to include everything else and/or be above everything else in the cosmological hierarchy will either be structurally identical to The Box or end up being smaller than it and, therefore, contained by it.
According to this law, such attempts only end up creating different points of view of the same top level structure, nothing more.
An example of this is the Imaginarium which, despite being quite different in description to the Box still is structurally identical to it on a fundamental level. Both are the fictional containers for everything. Both contain smaller elements (Altarcae and Imaginata) which are individual independent cosmologies. Those contain everything else inside them in some inner organization. Both contain themselves infinitely many times, both contain all versions of themselves, both contain things larger than themselves, including larger versions of themselves, both contain the set of things not contained by them.
An implied consequence of this law is that there is actual no way of fully describing that common top level structure. It is always possible to create a new different point of view of it so its description can always be augmented that way. These different points of view correspond to different areas of the structure because it is not, and cannot be, homogeneous in nature. If it where it would not be complete.
As a reply to this blog post, it is possible to say that such top level structure does not lack anything at all. If it did it would not be complete. Only a specific point of view of it lacks some things. But whenever something it lacks is pointed out, one can just change the point of view to another one that doesn't lack that thing at all. This makes it a never ending game, one person point out things it lacks and the other changing the point of view to one not lacking those things.
It is not possible to have a single point of view that lacks nothing by itself as that would make it higher than the structure itself and break this law. It would always be possible to find something that point of view would lack. For example if it where complete it would lack incompleteness, if it where homogeneous it would lack heterogeneity, etc. If it didn't lacked anything it would lack lacking.
A different way to describe and connect these different points of view of such a structure is to imagine them as different areas of such structure. That way the Box is an area inside the Imaginarium and the Imaginarium is an area inside the Box.
The current Box equivalent structures on this wiki are:
-The Box
-The Omniumverse

A note about Box Transcendentalism
This "law" was made under the assumption that the Box is absolute and cannot be beaten, transcended or surpassed at all. By accepting the idea of Box Transcendentalism one disputes that idea. Doing so breaks this law in the sense that it no longer applies to the Box in the first place. The fundamental aspect of this law is not that it says that new structures are top level because they are equivalent to the Box. Instead it says that new structures are equivalent to the Box because they are top level.
What this law actually says is that all top level structures are equivalent in that they can all be seen as different points of view or different descriptions of the same thing that is an abstract top level structure. The Box was named by it because it was a known top level structure. If one no longer accepts the Box as being top level, this law no longer applies to it which means that the Box would no longer be "Box equivalent" for this purpose.
New structures that are created at this level and that fall under this law would not actually be Box equivalent any more but would, instead, be equivalent with whatever new, and higher than the Box, top level structure there is.</pre>
