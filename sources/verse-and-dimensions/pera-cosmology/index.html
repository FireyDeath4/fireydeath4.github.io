Parafield

Level: Low Pera-cosmological
Position - Location: Ingena
Position - Contents: Itfield
Size - Dimensionality: A different scale altogether.
Soupcount ordinal index: Inapplicable

To explain it (somewhat), they are a level of systems in pera-cosmology. The first Parafield is just an Itfield, all that can be contained. The second is all that can be contained, all that cannot be contained, the third is what is, isn't and in between being able to be contained, continue for all Parafields in an Ingen. Any n-ary field could be considered a shadow of the parafield at the same level (i.e, Binaryfield is the shadow of Parafield(2))
to describe its sheer size, you could say that this is a type of field that is contained within Ingena which contains all and everything. Almost everything in existence confuses this with The Box , but it is still not at that level, for The Box is absolute, forever, while this can still be paradoxically contained within something, for it has no rules other than it is all.
Parafields are only within reach of the best of omnipotent entities, untouchable by Aspect Lords of any kind, something below TTG (The True God) but above Aspect Lords is at this level. If an entity, somehow, got here, it would be just fine, but no entity below TTG can reach this place with the power they possess. If some hyper-advanced species got here, they would define this as The Box, or whatever they would call it.

Ingena

Type: unimaginable
Level: Low-Mid Pera-cosmological
Inhabitants: if it can live, it is here
Position - Location: The Box
Position - Contents: Everything that can be contained, including all Parafields
Soupcount ordinal index: nonexistent

Container of all levels of Parafields, yet still non-exsistent compared to The Box, this is the next step in Pera-cosmology. Some people say it has level Φ(ω) (Veblen function) of Parafield, but this is false. It has the final, truly infinite level of Parafield, not even 0=1 level is true. Any sort of attempt to explain this would completely fail, even trying to explain how much you cannot explain it would melt my mind and yours alike, this is truly gargantuan. It is what cannot be grasped my physical minds, we would have to have omnipotence^ε0 in order to even think about entering an Ingen (singular for Ingena). Our local Ingena is known as The Barrelplexian, no need for a new post.</pre>
