Paradox Space

Paradox space is the space outside of the omniverse containing everything that doesn't exist, outside of reality. It is called paradox space because the most overt generator of nonexistence is paradoxes, things that contain contradictions that prohibits them from ever forming inside the normal omniverse. In Holomanga's cosmology this corresponds to areas of the cosmos that do not follow the rules of classical logic.
The outer boundary of paradox space is the surface in the Box at which the concept of unreality fails to be meaningful; paradox space can be thought of as the container of the strictly nonexistent part of the Box, as reality is the container of the strictly existent part.

Paradoxical manipulation
With Paradox Manipulation, anything is possible, even irrational and impossible things. Paradox Manipulation is the power to overcome and distort any rule of reality, logic or common sense. It is the sub-power of Omnipotence in which everything impossible becomes possible, relying on contradictions, since there is no need for a why, only a want, the entity overcomes and ignores the laws of reality, logic, common sense, concepts, making them able to make anything happen or not happen. The application of this power can be quite irrational to the lower entities, never making any sense as to how the entity is following such things. Often, Entities of this power are absolutely immune to almost or all existing powers, as the power itself operates entirely outside of logic, reason and understanding. Logic is invalid for this power.
