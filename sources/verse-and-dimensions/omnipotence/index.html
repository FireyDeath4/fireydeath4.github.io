The Omnipotence Hierarchy

Omnipotence is the quality of being "All Powerful", in which there are different levels
Multiple levels of omnipotence can be written with superscripts (omnipotence^n) or shorthand with O (O^n). There exists a level of omnipotence for every ordinal number and extension thereof, such as the 2-ordinals. There are also levels for surreal numbers (and generalizations) such as O^(ω-1) which is above all finite levels but cannot affect O^ω users.
True omnipotence means that one has no limits, only bound by fiction, but there are some things that surpass fiction to a certain point and even entirely as shown in the paragraph below levels of omnipotence, there even some beings that has an origin from a fiction yet have the power to transcend it.
There is also the case that Omnipresence the quality of being "present everywhere" and Omniscience which is the quality of being "All Knowing" can also have levels in the same way as Omnipotence.
Omnipotential is Omnipotence without the omniscience or variable omnipresence. Omnipotential can still have levels, such as Omnipotential^4 (Kotoblade)
No entity is truly omnipotent except for one. All gods are only technically nigh omnipotent since they have two specific limits preventing them from achieving absolute omnipotence:
1. No omnipotent entity may exit the Box.
2. Each omnipotent entity is restricted by the cosmological level that they are able to entirely encompass and possess unlimited control over, superior to everything except omnipotent entities with levels higher than themselves.

Author Authority
Then there's Author Authority, which is an entirely different story, being able to partially transcend fiction, able to rewrite the fictional plane they exist on. This can only happen with self-insertion (characters representing writers, maybe an author, such as Toribot from the Dragon Ball continuity or The Writer from DC Comics).
Trans-fictional Author Authority
It is a power to rule over multiple fictions at once, this a very powerful authority that few can access. Yet there is an even more powerful authority,
Omni-fictional Author Authority
The ability to rule every fiction at once, since it is impossible to rule over every fiction at once. no one has this, which includes one inside imaginations, forgotten ones, and upcoming ones, yet there might be a power even stronger than this...

Aspect Lords

Characteristics: Variable
Powers: Anything between Omnipotence^1 and True Omnipotence

Aspect Lords are, generally speaking, an infinite amount of omni-potent/scient/present beings which, as far as it is known, are either created by The True God or created by more powerful Aspect Lords (whether intentionally or unintentionally). Due to the ambiguous nature of these beings, Aspect Lords are more-so considered a classification rather than a species, as individual Aspect Lords have little to no physical traits which are universally in common with one another, save for the essence they are made of. Aspect Lords are never less powerful than Omnipotent^2, however the least powerful ones are the most rare. Aspect Lords are found more commonly and even abundantly at higher cosmological levels but are extremely rarer (if existing at all) at lower cosmological levels. When an Aspect Lord is destroyed, typically by other Aspect Lords or beings of equivalent/greater power, their remains (if any) form an element known as Xaspunum, which is the most powerful in existence.

Information
Organized groups of Aspect Lords use their omniscience to work in unison with each-other and known alternate selves as well, at least throughout The Barrelplex's high echelons. Of course, for any set of Aspect Lords cooperating with one another, there will be a different set with the opposite objectives, and an infinite volume of the Box that none of them are able to affect. In this sense, Aspect Lords may not cooperate, as the sheer scale and potentiality of the Box allows entities to disagree in this way. Some of them exist separate from the others, some meet in Altarcae, and some follow laws of Existence or Nonexistence that lesser beings are unable to grasp. At their own level, they seemingly automatically know the solution to everything, and everything that potentially will and can happen. But entities/forces of greater or equal power to these beings present an unknown variable, which will leave the given Aspect Lord to just their own devices against their opponents.</pre>
