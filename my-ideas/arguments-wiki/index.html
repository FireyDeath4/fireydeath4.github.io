<h1>Arguments Wiki context pages</h1>
<p>The wiki also has a <a href="https://discord.gg/QwMPF53RwJ">Discord server</a> by the way, even though the site's not really being hosted anywhere other than in this microcosmic assortment of pages. So you can join that if you want. It's a very dormant server but you can still discuss stuff like page content and wiki structure and ideas/plans for the wiki as a whole</p>
<h2>Explanatory pages</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="/my-ideas/arguments-wiki/reasons-why-it-needs-to-exist">Reasons Why The Argument Wiki Needs To Exist</a> - a highly-curated well-organised page enumerating every general reason for why it needs to exist. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to get a basic and efficient yet thorough appreciation of the idea, and definitely the main page you should read</li>
  <li><a href="/my-ideas/arguments-wiki/about-page-dump">About page dump</a> - it's a bit disorganised and rambly but it has a lot of more nuanced and specific thoughts that should help the point hit home more closely to your property's centre of mass</li>
</ul>
<h2>Sample pages</h2>
<p>I don't really have any good, well-developed pages on topics where the structure I proposed in the explanatory pages would shine, since I was the only one doing anything on the wiki before it got taken down from Fandom, and I'm still kind of a noob to a lot of things. These examples are really rough stuff and have a lot of silly rambling I put there while I was busy adding pages and content, but they should give you a bit of an idea of what the page structures and ideas would look like</p>
<p>BTW, the pages have a lot of links to wiki pages that did and didn't exist that don't go anywhere here on this site. Mostly the only links that work are the ones for the references and external links.</p>
<p>Also, these are not the only pages I made. Perhaps you might find something useful in one of the other pages, for whatever reason. If you want, I can just send you a copy of the Fandom wiki's dump file, or let you choose pages for me to add from the list of page-names</p>
<h3>Focus on structure</h3>
<p>They've still got rambling</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="/my-ideas/arguments-wiki/pineapple-on-pizza">Does pineapple belong on pizza?</a></li>
  <li><a href="/my-ideas/arguments-wiki/gambling">Gambling</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Focus on rambling</h3>
<p>I don't really know how these pages would be relevant to demonstrating the idea of the Arguments Wiki, but maybe you might see something useful in these presentations before I do</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="/my-ideas/arguments-wiki/free-will">Free-will</a> (mostly a schizo rant about why metaphysical libertarianism can't possibly be anything other than utter nonsense based on illusory oblivion)</li>
  <li><a href="/my-ideas/arguments-wiki/morality">Morality</a> (mostly a crash-out at the overly convoluted concept of correct alignment. In fact there's actually another specific thought I had about it at the about-page)</li>
</ul>
