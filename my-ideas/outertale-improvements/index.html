<p>Hello! <b style="font-size:100px">THERE ARE SPOILERS</b></p>
<p>Outertale has a lot of really interesting ideas, but some of them fall flat and feel very neglected and strange. After watching some playthroughs and reading a bunch of comments, I came up with some ideas on how to make them work better, as usual.</p>
<h2>Bully Pacifist Route</h2>
<p>The idea of a dark pacifist route where you save everyone but also treat them horribly and nearly beat all of them to death is really intriguing. It would have been really impactful if it significantly changed the way that the game played out okay look enough with this silly speech let me just write the ideas</p>
<ul>
  <li>From the outset, split it into two distinctive routes: the warrior route and the bully route. In the warrior route, you fight everyone who attacks you and then spare them, while in the bully route, you also have to fight unwilling monsters and treat them with cruelty and contempt.</li>
  <li>Change the game. Since the chaotic route is not as focused on utter tedium and demoralisation as Undertale is with the genocide route, make the bully route the one where all the fun you get is siphoned into the encounters where you get to beat the monsters up and treat them horribly - which is obviously what you came here to do. Skip all of the puzzles and festivities like Undertale does in the genocide route, and reintroduce the abusive master/inferior relationship dynamic that set humans and monsters apart.</li>
  <li>Make certain monsters choose to not attack you, and/or consistently try to spare you or flee. Some monsters should be spareable immediately. This will filter out the self-defence defence and distinguish the bully route from the warrior route.</li>
  <li>Make the actions have consequences. Since Outertale ditches the mechanic where monsters' emotional vulnerability and attackers' violent intent change how much damage the monsters receive, also ditch the part where there is always an obvious penultimate blow - in other words, make accidental kills possible. It will make the route harder to pull off without collapsing into a neutral route, and you might need to do more fights or reload.</li>
  <li>Change the interactions in the hangout session with Undyne. They need patching since she still tells you that you're a wimpy loser with a big heart, despite the fact that you specifically searched for every monster you could encounter, beat them until they're just about to fall down, and treated them all with cruelty. Here are some changes I'd add:
  <ul>
    <li>Make Frisk deliberately splash the drink on Undyne's face automatically. This will keep you on track for the route and skip all of the backstory that's clearly not for you.</li>
    <li>Make Frisk's strong vegetable attack smash the vegetables directly into Undyne's face.</li>
    <li>Make the stove knob turn twice as fast as usual.</li>
    <!--<li>Make Frisk's attack, instead of only doing one damage, reduce Undyne's HP all the way to 1. To stay on the pacifist route, you will need to keep sparing her until she gets exhausted. But wait, oh no, that's inconsistent with the ditched mechanic I mentioned earlier... dang I thought I was onto something there...</li>-->
    <li>After Frisk's attack, give them the option to spare instead of automatically ending the encounter. To stay on the route, you will need to beat Undyne to near-death a second time. She will tell you to stop and leave, but after another attack or two, she'll give in and start a rematch. Since she's exhausted from the last battle, her attacks won't be as strong, but the fires in the house will start to enclose around you, appearing in the background as well as in the battle box like an increasingly claustrophobic support attack, the heat will start inducing the wave effect seen in the Pyrope fight, and she'll start getting progressively more desperate to end the fight and leave the house. If you take too many turns, she'll start taking damage from the fire around her, and you might even have to save her.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Rework the call that comes after Asriel's fight.
  <ul>
    <li>Don't have the call happen automatically. Make the player have to slowly realise what's just happened, rather than do a trite exposition dump.</li>
    <li>Require the player to call a phone three times before anyone answers.</li>
    <li>Change the dialogue. The current one sucks. It just has Papyrus and Undyne telling you matter-of-factly what just happened and asserting the premise behind every monster leaving you before you wake up, and as several people mentioned already, it's very out-of-character for him. Instead, divert the focus from him and Toriel and have others initially answer the phone, like Papyrus somewhat wants to talk to you but keeps being talked down by other monsters who assert that it's not a good idea, and Toriel is very unsure about getting involved.</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul>
<h2>Chaotic Route</h2>
<p>An obvious glaring plot hole people keep pointing out is how loading after the shuttle explodes doesn't do anything to make Frisk or Asriel acknowledge the ending at all.</p>
<h2>Other</h2>
<ul>
  <li>In the Omega Twinkly fight, make the C key switch the soul mode like it does in Undertale DDD 1.5. This will make you actually have to manage different elements.</li>
</ul>
