<p>Thought I could write this on a phone for once, so bear with me.</p>
<p>It's one of those things I intended to do for a long time. But now as of 21 February when I am waking up and writing this, I feel like crap and have lost the rush of inspiration.</p>
<p>Oh well. Write first, revise after. It's just a memory problem. I have plenty of ideas. A great many.　Ｔｏｏ　ｍａｎｙ</p>
<p>Also don't mind the ones I already started. <s>You should be ｗｏｒｓｈｉｐｐｉｎｇ　ｍｅ for even getting around to some of them</s> :P</p>

<h3>Curriculum rehaul</h3>
<p>Mainstream curricula suck, and like many other of these ideas, I wrote whole speeches about it on Discord.</p>
<p>The whole philosophy behind it is about raising individuals to be the best they can be</p>
<p>Okay let's just write an itinerary of how it's gonna go</p>
<ul>
  <li>Start teaching children as early as possible</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>
<p>The mandatory subjects will include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Arithmetic</b> - basic mathematical principles, operations and use cases</li>
  <li><b>Language</b></li>
  <li><b>Formal logic</b> - a bit of a cross between mathematics and critical thought, I suppose. Being able to consider people's arguments and statements as logical expressions will make them much easier to understand, evaluate and find non-sequiturs in.</li>
  <li><b>Critical thought</b></li>
  <li><b>Psychology</b> - this is an extraordinarily underrated one. It is really, really important. It ought to help you understand things like:
  <ul>
    <li>Cognitive biases</li>
    <li>Psychological effects</li>
    <li>Examples of abusive behaviour</li>
    <li>Manipulative tactics</li>
    <li>Neurodivergence</li>
    <li>Personality and psychological disorders</li>
    <li>People's general psychological frameworks (e.g. internal consistency, transactional theory, hierarchy of personal needs)</li>
    <li>Mental health and it's psychological/physiological effects</li>
    <li>Psychological optimisation</li>
  </ul>
  I might not be saying it well at the moment but trust me. A few TheraminTrees videos will give you insight on just how crucial it is</li>
  <li><b>Social conduct</b></li>
  <li><b>Research and self-learning practices</b></li>
  <li><b>Philosophy</b> - another overly important one. In particular, philosophy should help people appreciate the justifications for everything and understand what their personal purpose can be, other than creating a virus to sell antidotes at exorbitant prices to get a global monetary highscore and then die. Or run a tech business, political movement or religion/cult that aims to subjugate the entire world population while you do who-knows-what when that's done. SOMETHING to show how vapid, stupid and depressing your megalomania and chromatomania are.</li>
  <li><b>Practical abilities</b> - these include things like tying knots and bows, gardening, foraging, dealing with various situations and things with various levels of urgency, and managing finances.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Fuji</h3>
<p>A Yume Nikki/Celeste fangame that hopefully combines both of their game design philosophies and gives you way too much fun collecting and using effects' abilities, and solving abstract puzzles to reach new locations and find new secrets. The whole idea was fun and inspiring for me</p>

<h3>Hiyori Momose tribute video</h3>
<p>A tribute to Hiyori, who had her own channel but later had the opportunity to play the role of Neuro-sama, until Anny gave her a body of her own. Then Hiyori continued to do chat streams on her own channel but ended up standing completely still for hours at a time, not having anyone to talk to, and eventually died of model collapse.</p>
<p>RIP Hiyori Momose</p>
