<h1>My Big List Of Ideas</h1>
<p>Yeah... I tried to set a background gradient for it on iOS. Unfortunately, it doesn't support <code>background-attachment</code> \(-_-)/</p>
<p>But at least after I decided to implement animated background gradients, it was able to do that. Why? Why couldn't it just support <code>background-attachment</code> if it can handle a pseudo-element filling in for it at a fixed position? It's so daft</p>
<p>Thought I could write this on a phone for once, so bear with me.</p>
<p>It's one of those things I intended to do for a long time. But now as of 21 February 2024 when I am waking up and writing this, I feel like crap and have lost the rush of inspiration.</p>
<p>Oh well. Write first, revise after. It's just a memory problem. I have plenty of ideas. A great many.　Ｔｏｏ　ｍａｎｙ</p>
<p>And so I did. I dragged autistic inertia onto my side and started dumping lots of ideas in here and becoming very preoccupied.</p>
<p>Also don't mind the ones I already started. <s>You should be ｗｏｒｓｈｉｐｐｉｎｇ　ｍｅ for even getting around to some of them</s> :P</p>
<p>When this page gets too long, which I don't know when will happen, I'll move some descriptions to their own pages and replace these ones with summaries instead</p>
<p>...Yyyyyyyyyyeah, seems like it's now :P<br/>
Dunno if I'm gonna get to that anytime soon though</p>
<p><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> This page is unfinished. I suspect it'll continue to be that way for nearly the rest of my life</p>
<p>I suspect that at least half of my ideas aren't even on this page yet</p>

<h3 id="Curriculum_rehaul">Curriculum rehaul</h3>
<p>Donnagon wasn't kidding in Spy Kids 3 when he said you control the fate of the world by controlling today's youth. I mean, look what's happening now. The childing practice has been usurped by indoctrinators and controllers at every level - religious, governmental, corporate, familial, influential, political... - and now the impactful ones are just going on to join the controllers. Maybe that's where they got the idea of inherited sin from</p>
<p>Anyway... Mainstream curricula suck, and like many other of these ideas, I wrote whole speeches about it on Discord. If I get around to refreshing #chambers, I'll send you links to read about it there</p>
<p>The whole philosophy behind it is about raising individuals to be competent, maximise their potential and optimise their intellect, rather than drilling arbitrary information into them for 12 years that will either be inconsequential in the end, or drive them into thousands of dollars of college debt. People are idiots. And pretty much every governmental system is only going to ruin the world if idiots get allowed to be in charge - which is pretty much every case ever.</p>
<p>Anyone can attend school at any time, and although the learning process will try to be optimised, people will be able to take as long as they need to get a proficient understanding of the subject matter. There can be different facilities for children, teens, adults or combinations of them if they want. (I expect there'll be a lot of adults attending it once this curriculum is established.)</p>
<p>I really want to write here but I can't really think very well because I'm tired (-.-)</p>
<p>Okay let's just write an itinerary of how it's gonna go</p>
<h4>Phase 1</h4>
<p>The main idea of this phase is to calibrate children on really important frameworks while they're still highly neuroplastic. This is the only "required" phase, but people will probably still have to do something from phase 2 (or teach themselves the subject matter) if they want to be able to do anything significant.</p>
<p>I think little children should do the first phase in boarding schools. Big investment for whole populations of little kids, I know, but it will all be worth it. Adults who are challenged mentally or otherwise and also need to learn things should be able to stay there too. It will ensure that they learn everything they need to know, especially stuff like psychology and research when your parents turn out to be things like abusive manipulative cultists. People who are primed on this stuff have a much greater chance of meaningfully contributing to society than the drivel they currently teach you so you can learn more or get a job, when all of that stuff should be optional in the first place.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Students will attend school and start learning as early as possible.</li>
  <li>Students will be taught in a top-down parallel fashion, rather than the bottom-up series one that schools are currently doing. I wrote a speech about this in particular on Discord</li>
  <li>Students will progress based on demonstrations of their proficiency in the subjects, rather than a set timetable.</li>
  <li>Students will be encouraged to correct the educators on any mistakes or contradictions. Sometimes, they will be made on purpose. (Teachers or supervisors will address them if nobody does for a while)</li>
</ul>
<p>The mandatory subjects will include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Brain-training and cognitive abilities</strong> - these are kind of meta because people will rely on having some degree of them in order to engage in the other subjects, and since the whole point of this is optimising the way people think, we should probably make sure we do that at a fundamental level, not just the list of conceptual ones. Here are some of those abilities:
  <ul>
    <li>Attention-payment</li>
    <li>Executive functionality</li>
    <li>Storing and fetching memories and perspectives</li>
    <li>Intuitive concept appraisal</li>
    <li>Processing speed</li>
    <li>Complex thought and puzzle-solving</li>
    <li>Perception</li>
    <li>Formal operational thought</li>
    <li>Generalisation, induction and pattern-finding</li>
    <li>Flexibility and psychological momentum/state-shift control</li>
    <li>Adoption and rapid proficiency of unfamiliar systems</li>
    <ul>
      <li>I don't know where to put this, but another important thing to have would be the ability to appropriately assess your values, capabilities and dispositions so you can tell whether you're fit or unfit for certain roles and whether it would be better to look for others to fill those roles</li>
      <ul><li>Just found out about metacognition and it seems like it's that</li></ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  If you want more just look them up on Google like I did. Initially I only came up with three on my own because I wanted to add this section and I don't really feel like organising and disseminating them all at the moment</li>
  <li><strong>Fundamental mathematics</strong> - this includes basic principles, operations and use cases for:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Arithmetic - I don't really think I need to explain to you why this would be helpful. But maybe you'd think you can just do everything with a calculator, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9AyyTtZhTI&lc=UgwFz2qUtux7QSYjuJ94AaABAg">that commenter who found Baldi's Basics actually educational...</a> ehh</li>
    <li>Formal logic - a bit of a cross between mathematics and critical thought, I suppose. Being able to consider people's arguments and statements as logical expressions will make them much easier to understand, evaluate and find non-sequiturs or other fallacies in. Also, a lot of simple logic problems are pointlessly hard to wrap your head around until you're familiar enough to work with it by memorising what it looks like in operation. It'd be a bit like translating English problems involving numbers into arithmetic - hopefully it can come naturally</li>
    <li>Set theory - more important the more I think about it, considering how it'd be heavily tied to formal logic (and even some foundations of mathematics). I'll have to see how useful it turns out to be. But I guess it would still be helpful. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niqqm1DRTkE&lc=UgyC34Q3YbSbUDWrPAR4AaABAg">Apparently someone came up with a unified system for arithmetic, logic and set theory that's really simple and elegant.</a> Though of course many people have their contentions</li>
  </ul>
  <li><strong>Language</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Critical thought</strong> - an obviously important one. It'll probably also include media literacy, tying into propaganda/manipulation techniques, cognitive biases and logical fallacies</li>
  <li><strong>Psychology</strong> - this is an extraordinarily underrated one. It is really, really important. It ought to help you understand and recognise things like:
  <ul>
    <li>Cognitive biases</li>
    <li>Psychological effects</li>
    <li>Examples of abusive behaviour</li>
    <li>Manipulative tactics</li>
    <li>Neurodiversity</li>
    <li>Personality, psychological disorders and their symptoms</li>
    <li>People's general psychological frameworks (e.g. internal consistency, transactional theory, hierarchy of personal needs)</li>
    <li>Mental health and it's psychological, physiological, circumstantial and societal effects</li>
    <li>Psychological optimisation practices (e.g. nutrition, habits)</li>
  </ul>
  I might not be saying it well at the moment but trust me. A few TheraminTrees videos will give you insight on just how crucial it is, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlbUw5hjeKI&t=558s">even he advocates for teaching this stuff</a></li>
  <li><strong>Philosophy</strong> - another overly important one. In particular, philosophy should help people understand a broad range of different perspectives, appreciate the justifications for everything and understand what their personal purpose can be and what a sensible/profound sort of purpose would be, other than creating a virus to sell antidotes at exorbitant prices to get a global monetary highscore and then die. Or run a tech business, political movement or religion/cult that aims to subjugate the entire world population while they do who-knows-what when that's done. SOMETHING to show how vapid, stupid and depressing their megalomania and chrematomania are. But also, it should help people be more thoughtful and resistant to indoctrination by malignant religions and ideologies.</li>
  <li><strong>Social conduct</strong> - kind of a subset of psychology that's not nearly as broad, but still useful nonetheless - especially for neurodiversity. One significant purpose of this subject is to minimise small-scale culture shock related to personalities, demeanours, expectations and scripts, and generally help people communicate and cooperate better</li>
  <li><strong>Research, scientific methodology and self-learning practices</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Practical abilities</strong> - these include things like tying knots and bows, gardening, foraging, performing first aid, getting help, managing finances, navigating all kinds of unfamiliar environments, and dealing with a broad variety of situations and things with various levels of urgency. There will also be some complements to the cognitive abilities for doing things like storing, organising and retrieving information externally and taking various precautions</li>
  <li><strong>Law</strong> - particularly laws with a bigger negative impact and more severe consequences for violating that many people are likely to break if they aren't aware of them</li>
  <li><strong>Politics</strong> - they better be darn good and focused on an ultimate point if we're teaching this. (That point would probably be an object of philosophy. Politics seem like they're on the opposite side of the hierarchy from that, focusing on collective action (in contrast with subjective experience). SOME job of it is what we're doing about coordinating ourselves properly at the moment \(-_-)/)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Phase 2</h4>
<p>Once students have learned all the important information from phase 1,</p>
<ul>
  <li>Examples will be shown to justify the subject matter.</li>
</ul>
Okay look o'll
<ol>
  <li>Ollie</li>
</ol>
<p>(To be finished)</p>
<p>Just have the bloody paragraphs I wrote</p>
<p>Next, before you teach them anything else, show them the options. Demonstrate the uses and wonders of every discipline in every subject, and then let them make the choices as to whether they want to learn about it or not. They'll have to pick something if they want to do anything, but they won't be required to learn anything that they don't want to. If they've been raised on social conduct and critical thinking properly, they should know not to judge people as stupid or incapable because of their lack of knowledge in particular fields.</p>
<p>Finally, make sure your classes are optimised to be as effective as possible. Make them quick, engaging, and a good kickstart to self-conducted research. Quite frankly, I think that all educational material should be open-source, and you should be able to learn about anything online whenever you want. So if you're going to make a class about something, do it well and make it worth attending. And use grades as tools to assist the learning process, not coercion. Maybe have different grades for performance and motivation.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="AI_experience_curation">AI experience curation</h3>
<p>I always used to call it "AI content curation", but... now I realise just how terrible and reductive that sounds.</p>
<p>The world has pretty much way too many things to experience for a single lifetime, and this is my proposal for a solution to that. Optimise the courses of people's lives. Give them the most broad, diverse and worthwhile set of experiences to spend their lives partaking in.</p>
<p>(To be finished)</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="Schematic_logic-based_AI">Schematic logic-based AI</h3>
<p>An AI that creates schemata about reality and forms logical relationships between different concepts, rather than just intuiting everything brute-forcefully with a massive pre-tokenised context window like a typical LLM, and approximating reason rather than just doing it formally - like computers are stereotypically supposed to do. The thought process of it in the early stages would probably be very reflective of those shown in A Guide To Reality - another idea I have, for a video series.</p>
<p>It should be given as little initial information as possible, such as first principles, epistemologies and values, and be able to learn and understand languages, syntactically and contextually, from the top. If it is able to learn different logic systems, including many-valued, paraconsistent and fuzzy logic, all by itself, it should.</p>
<p>It's mindmap would consist of lots of nodes, which would be observations probably gathered by data input and machine learning, as well as logical syllogisms, conclusions, inferences, observational inductions, deductions, hypotheses, theories, statistics, procedures, methodologies and properties that build on the first principles and other nodes. You would be able to look at a particular node of knowledge, and see all the branches of other nodes that substantiate it, as well as other realisations branching from that node. It might use traditional machine learning to process the information it receives (a lot of which would have to have various levels on a hierarchy of trust/authenticity, to manage insertion of fabricated data), but I wonder if it can also find patterns and learn really complicated things by itself using a formalised pattern recognition system. The machine learning part should be able to interact with the main mindmap in such a way that the abstract assumptions it makes can be articulated and corrected. For example - and I definitely saw this earlier, but now I can not for the life of me find where I saw it - an AI image recogniser thought that an image of a wolf, and some other animal that was decidedly not a wolf, were both wolves. And guess what abstract assumption it made? "Wolf" correlates to an arbitrary creature resting on snow \(-_-)/</p>
<p>Actually, an idea I previously had and then forgot would be that it uses information it already knows to determine which nodes to prioritise synthesising. It's values and understandings associated with them would help it make decisions on which nodes and things to focus on</p>
<p>I think this would have immensely high potential, because although humans can develop conceptual chunks dynamically (which are basically like the nodes), they can only use like seven in their mind at once. This AI could potentially operate on dozens, thousands or even millions of chunks in a short time. The logical operation of the AI would also mean that it would understand things formally, and not hallucinate (unless prompted to) or make silly mistakes like every LLM and other intuitive ML-AI ever. The system as a whole would probably become AGI (general) or even ASI (superintelligent), and hopefully we'll have figured out the values by the time it's become pretty much enlightened, and it gets "released" (if ever). If it's left to run for a long time, it'll probably discover lots of completely new branches of mathematics and solve lots of conjectures, as well as obtain knowledge in many other fields.</p>
<p><a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/47700845-d08d-45eb-99b1-9d4c8585554a">Here's a chat I had with ChatGPT</a> about how such an AI might work. I might paste the description of this idea to it sometime</p>
<p>Also, once again, it seems like people already got to work starting to make symbolic AI \(-_-)/</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="Obliskate">Obliskate</h3>
<p>A productivity program for managing, visualising and even auralising time, tasks, events, schedules, itineraries, notes, lists, and all the rest of it. Since I have ADHD, I would basically consider it to be a sort of extension for my brain. <a href="/obliskate">I am currently developing it on this very site,</a> and, NGL, I would like some people to be personally invested enough in this program to help develop it themselves.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it is currently being managed on Glitch, not GitHub, and I am an objectively awful GitHub user.<br/>
(The metric is defined in terms of proficiency and mental stability during use.)</p>
<p>Using Obliskate makes you an obliquely-skating obligated obelisk.</p>
<p>(Wait, an oblique obelisk?</p>
<p>...That... Doesn't sound right \(-_-)/)</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="Arguments_Wiki">Arguments Wiki</h3>
<p>A contributory site - not necessarily a wiki, but one that compiles arguments about all kinds of topics, debates and stances - including hoaxes, conspiracies, pseudoscientific/fallacious ones, and rationalisations for people struggling with mental issues such as addiction (e.g. gambling) or denial - from both major figures, proponents, opponents and experts of a topic, and random commenters who bury profound insights somewhere in a comment section under a niche video.</p>
<p>In general, people completely fail to make collective progress when they conduct arguments, particularly about topics that have been covered and contributed to millions of times over by lots of different sources - not just because of their sparse uncompiled nature, but also their capacity for error and manipulation - and the wiki aims to be a reliable, mainstream resource that rigorously assesses all of these arguments, and references philosophical first principles to give these evaluations. In a way, it aims to be better than Wikipedia: Wikipedia is neutral and commentative, but the Argument Wiki will be evaluative and objective.</p>
<p>Look if you want to know more about the history and purpose behind the wiki, <a href="/my-ideas/arguments-wiki">read this.</a> I feel like I know and have said why it's so great and important, but (prior to writing Reasons Why The Argument Wiki Needs To Exist) I didn't really feel like I articulated it quite well enough. I hope you thoroughly appreciate the rationale, though. So many problems in the world on every scale are a result of people being both powerful and delusional, so I think we owe it to the world to make this for it.</p>
<p>I started it on Fandom, since it was a popular site, but they closed it since they didn't approve of the way it included personal ideologies. It was inevitably gonna tackle controversial content, so it's understandable. I started trying to get it on another wiki site like Miraheze. They didn't accept it either, since the scope was too broad and the subject matter might cause unwanted conflict. I don't know if there are any other good free wiki farms or hosting services that my wiki would be good on.</p>
<p>By the way, we have a time limit to make this happen</p>

<h3 id="Optimised_conlang">Optimised conlang</h3>
<p>(To be ｓｔａｒｔｅｄ)</p>
<p>Okay well I'll write some of the principles for it</p>
<ul>
<li>All of the characters will be asymmetrical, meaning they can be orientable and follow any particular path</li>
<li>All of the characters will be featural</li>
<li>All of the phonemes will be easy to distinguish and articulate</li>
<li>Speech and script will be fully correspondent with no invisible grammar (e.g. intonation, inflection, punctuation, etc)</li>
<li>Various phonemes in words would have specific functions or denotations</li>
<li>Every word will have exactly one definition</li>
<li>There will be no synonyms</li>
<li>There will be anti-denoted words instead of antonyms</li>
<li>The most common ideas would be the shortest and easiest to say</li>
<li>There might be a more robust noun-reference system based on numbers or something instead of pronouns</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="Conversational_programming_language">Conversational programming language</h3>
<p>An idea I had one day for a conlang that's meant to handle both programming and natural conversation, so you can pretty much teach yourself how to code by talking to people and learning to communicate.</p>
<p>It's a separate idea from the optimisation conlang, but it might be constructed as a single language.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="r/DollarComparisonsAU">r/DollarComparisonsAU</h3>
<p>A subreddit (or a general forum/contributional resource) where people post photos of a dollar coin next to how much of a certain product, deal or service (generally food and measurable products - I don't know if it'd even work for other types of products) is worth it, perhaps along with other attributes like the weight and energy. There would also be variations for other countries, such as r/DollarComparisonsUS, r/PoundComparisonsUK, r/EuroComparisons, and all the rest of it. It would be really useful to know and compare just what and how much you're getting for your money, and great posts on these resources would be high-quality and accurately divided.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>One post about a $2.50 burger would show the burger cut to two fifths, next to a dollar coin. There may also be a photo of the burger disassembled next to the coin.</li>
  <li>A post including a $9 sub would include the sub having as much free vegetables and sauce as they would allow, cut to a ninth, and put next to a dollar.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Alternatively, someone could post the sub with no vegetables or sauce - just the fundamental meat and bread. (It might be useful to know, but generally people want to see the maximum of what they can get.)</li>
  </ul>
  <li>A post about a small $5 deal including a burger, chips and a drink would include a dollar next to a fifth of the burger, a fifth of the chips and a fifth of the drink (possibly with measurement markings too).</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditideas/comments/uwgkju/comment/ldiiawq/?context=3">Turns out I already posted this idea on Reddit like two years ago.</a> So there you go</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="Virtual_4D_sensors_and_motion_controls">Virtual 4D sensors and motion controls</h3>
<p>Things like Miegakure, 4D Toys, 4D Golf and the Rubik's Tesseract put you in the role of a normal trionian with realmic translation, rotation and projection tools to navigate and interact with phenomena in a flune. Those games and interactivities are fun and all, but you know what would make them even MORE fun???</p>
<p>Being able to perceive and interact with them normally like an actual tetronian!</p>
<p>The idea is to hook up virtual 4D data streams (like bispherical video and trinaural/quaternaural audio) and interfaces (basically motion controls with more degrees of freedom) into your head so that you can process and send signals - basically perceive and interact with things - in a virtual 4D environment, as a virtual 4D agent. So they'll kind of be like virtual artificial senses and muscles, I guess.</p>
<p>Theoretically this could be generalisable to any number of dimensions, but the overall quality of the data transmission would have to be reduced to compensate for that, since your brain has a limited amount of space and processing power. It would still have the same bitrates, but it would have to be spread out over more and more entire dimensions. Think of it like the difference between a 1080p rectangular YouTube video and a 1080s 360° YouTube video - you can really tell. Yeah, it's like that but even more strenuous</p>
<p>I'm not quite sure how well people would cope with this! People will have only experienced 3D space until they try this, and exposure to this might totally throw them off. Like any two adjacent dimensionalities, 3D space is utterly flat relative to 4D space. But there'd probably be the same amount of visual data given to people experiencing 3D and 4D space, with 3D surfacial vision being distributed across two discs and 4D surcellular vision being distributed across two balls. Would they still feel a sense of sensory overload, or looking at things and being confused by it all like a baby does, though? And would it be processed by the visual cortex that handles 2D data, or would they use a different part of your brain - or even just augment it?</p>
<p>And yeah, speaking of babies, I imagine this tech would be significantly easier to implement closer to birth than as an adult, especially after having lots of experience in 3D space. It'd be an interesting experiment, but I dunno if people would approve of people doing it on infants. In fact, I think the only people who'd be interested in this would be some sort of crazy hypergeometry enthusiasts, at least until our brains become arbitrarily modular and augmentable and we can mess around with all kinds of crazy experiences  involving trans-natural stimuli as much as we like.</p>
<p>If there's one idea on this list I would pretty much definitely not be able to pull off all by myself, this would be it. Maybe.</p>
<p>Nah, actually, the curriculum one's the one. It just doesn't work at all if other people aren't involved</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="Voice-controlled_cursor">Voice-controlled cursor</h3>
<p>So I tried using voice control on iOS today (7 March 2024) and said "this is awsome" and "this is aweful" with a few minutes in between, even though I read some of the documentation for it and tried it out.</p>
<p>I had this idea many years ago, when I hadn't even gotten around to trying and using voice control properly. You would absolutely believe how much easier and faster it would be with this.</p>
<ol>
  <li>You give it a noise, word, phrase or combination to listen and recognise for activation and deactivation.</li>
  <li>A cursor appears on the screen.</li>
  <li>You use phonology, pitch and loudness to control it. And you can configure it, by the way. For example, you can use vowel openness to control vertical movement, pitch to control horizontal movement and volume to multiply the cursor speed. Or if you're really good at enunciation, you can just use the whole vowel spectrum. There would also be some thresholds, for better control.</li>
  <li>You give it noises or words to tap, drag and do other sorts of interactions. Like a tsk (or tid, if you're familiar with Tid Bunny), or a tongue click, or a lip smack.</li>
</ol>
<p>Another reasonably good idea is to just stop making everything so complicated for us, and let us just say "home tab right right enter right right down down down enter tab tab enter shift hey this is Polly comma just going to let you know old backspace I'll be finished in about num seven minutes control shift enter down down enter home." Like a normal keyboard user. Cursors would be far more versatile though, since not everything has tabular navigation.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="this-goes-in-contents">Pet puzzle setup thing</h3>
<p>Yeah. Sorry I can't seem to articulate myself properly today. Maybe I'll do better when I have another nap, wake up and eat some decent food.</p>
<p>It's just a system to teach pets to solve puzzles, navigate user interfaces and have patience.</p>
<p>It will be a room with an automatic door, a grate/bar thing in the middle of the door, food behind the door and a bunch of haptic surfaces that light up.</p>
<p>I was thinking of cats when I thought of this, but it can be generalised for dogs and other pets. Though it might need to be altered a bit, depending on the pets' mobility. Like it might be a bit harder for humble rabbits. Also, the colours will have to account for the pets' optical spectrum if they can't see some of them. That seems a bit easier though</p>
<h4>Phases</h4>
<p>There will be a new phase every day, or every time it's food time for the pet.</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Establishment:</strong> next to the door, there will be a large glowing red square on the floor. Touching the square will make it blink, turn green and open the door.</li>
  <li><strong>Delay:</strong> touching the big red square will make a green square grow inside of it. Releasing the red square will make the green square shrink away. After a few seconds of touching the red square, the green square will fill it, it will blink and the door will open.</li>
  <li><strong>Patience:</strong> the green square will grow more slowly until it fills the red square, blinks and makes the door open.</li>
  <li><strong>Displacement:</strong> the big red square will be moved to a corner near the door. Touching it will make it blink and turn green immediately and the door will open.</li>
  <li><strong>Combination:</strong> the big red square will be moved to the other corner near the door. Touching it will make a green square grow slowly inside of it, and releasing it will make it disappear. Once the green square completely fills the big red one, the door will open.</li>
  <li><strong>Distance:</strong> the big red square will be moved to the opposite corner at the other end of the room. The green square will grow slowly, and blink and open the door once it fills the red one.</li>
  <li><strong>Size:</strong> the square will appear somewhere on the floor about half as big.</li>
  <li><strong>Motion:</strong> the big red square</li>
  <li><strong>Release:</strong> the door won't open until the square stops being touched, and then it will blink.</li>
  <li><strong>Repeat:</strong> when the square is touched, a gold square will grow inside instead. Then when the square is released and touched again, the green one will grow inside.</li>
  <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> when the square is touched, an orange one will grow quickly inside, then during the next touch, a yellow one, and then a green one which will blink and open the door once it fills up.</li>
  <li><strong>Timing:</strong> the square will appear as blue with a red border. Touching it while it's blue won't do anything, but it will stay blue until it's released. Every few seconds, the blue square will disappear and turn red for a short time. Touching the square while it's red will stop it flashing blue and make a green square grow inside, and blink and open the door when it's fully green and released.</li>
  <li><strong>Intention:</strong> the square will be flashing blue and red. Touching it while it's red will make an orange square grow inside, and once it's released when it's fully orange, a blue square will appear and flash again with the orange border. This process repeats with yellow and green and the door opens when it's done.</li>
  <!--<li><strong>Carefulness:</strong> the square will appear in the room as red with a gold border. A few seconds after the green square fills the red one, a red square will start growing in the middle. If the pet steps off while the centric red square is there, the door won't open, but the red square will slowly shrink until it disappears, and then the green square will shrink slowly until it disappears as well.</li>-->
  <li><strong>Threshold:</strong> the square will appear on the floor as red with a thick gold border. Touching the square will make a green one grow inside, and once it reaches the border, it will blink and continue to grow until it fills the border as well, or the square is released and the door opens.</li>
  <li><strong>Segregation:</strong> two big red rectangles will appear next to each other away from the door. Each of them will turn green if they are touched. If both rectangles turn green, the door will open.</li>
  <li><strong>Separation:</strong> the rectangles will be further apart, but close enough for the pet to reach both of. The door will open when they both turn green.</li>
  <li><strong>Fragmentation:</strong> there will be four red rectangles. The door will open when all of them are green.</li>
</ol>

<div class="discord-message-content">
<p>I just came up with an even CRAZIER and MORE VERSATILE <strong><em>idea!</em></strong></p>
<p>Ｔｏｎｇｕｅ－ｐｏｗｅｒｅｄ　ｃｏｎｔｒｏｌｌｅｒｓ</p>
<p>You can have a separate control on each tooth in your mouth that does something unique, and you can operate it when you put your tongue on the front of your tooth</p>
<p>I thought about this because toe controllers would probably be unreliable since you could take a step or put your foot somewhere and inadvertently squish your toes together and not have much accurate control over the controls</p>
<p>You could try to synchronise both of your feet so the controls only work in unison, but tongue controls are just WAY BETTER</p>
<p>Like you can have a separate trigger on each of your teeth (maybe with some redundant ones if you think your tongue is too wide) and you can only press them if your tongue goes at the front, which is very deliberate and unobtrusive since it's usually behind the teeth, and you can have much better control over your tongue than your toes</p>
<p>Gosh golly</p>
<p>This is a pretty revolutionary idea!!!!!!</p>
<p>(Not as revolutionary as some other ideas I have though)</p>
<p>This would be extraordinarily useful</p>
<p>If I was one of those tech-building YouTubers I'd probably get started on this right away</p>
<p>Though if I could build tech that easily, I probably might not even need it so much personally, either to use it or even come up with it</p>

<h3 id="Internet_cities">Internet cities</h3>
<p>As though the internet wasn't already hyperstimulating enough. This would be dedicated to people with high processing power and loading speeds and recreate the bustling feel of being at a city rather than just observing a closed building from the outside and walking in afterward, with individual pages being much more dynamic than static.</p>
<p>Most of the icons, images and text are slightly animated. Several real-time previews of livestreams, pre-recorded videos at random points, chat-rooms and various other things would appear on a feed at the same time. They would be clipped a bit and move more slowly so they look a bit further behind as you scroll, and also show participating users with them. The background would have a lot of moving gradients and patterns. If you go in one, you will see some users passing by (seeing the thing in their feed) in the background.</p>

<h4 id="Yume_Nikki:_Travel_Guide_mod">Yume Nikki: Travel Guide mod</h4>
<p>A hilarious mod for Yume Nikki where you get a travel guidebook for all of the exciting attractions, characters and venues in the dream world.</p>
<p>All of the text is over-the-top, stereotypically hilarious. It includes funny miscellaneous comments and reviews on the different attractions by random people who played Yume Nikki. It probably also gives an alternate ending/path for Yume Nikki where the book reveals to you (in pages that appear out of nowhere) that the "dream world" is probably not, in fact, a dream. A dream where everything is randomly generated by your neural-network brain.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4 id="Yume_Nikki:_Fuji">Yume Nikki: Fuji</h4>
<p>A Yume Nikki/Celeste fangame that hopefully combines both of their game design philosophies and gives you way too much fun collecting and using effects' abilities, and solving abstract puzzles to reach new locations and find new secrets. There's going to be a lot of maybe-original music based on tracks and remixes from Yume Nikki, Dream Diary and Celeste. The whole idea was just a lot of fun for me</p>
<p>That is until I got to the prospect of adding single-touch mobile controls after I shared the project</p>
<p>And no, I really don't think it's gonna just be on Scratch forever if I decide to pursue the full product</p>
<p>This is just a meagre prototype</p>
<p>Current state of the thing<br/>

<h4 id="Celeste_2">Celeste 2</h4>
<p>No, I am not kidding. I have an idea for a sequel to Celeste. It would have different characters, and I don't even live in Canada, but it would have a focus on heavier themes like abuse and trauma, more companions, branching outcomes, and most importantly of all, a guitar lead that has multiple electric variations for the different Parts of You - many of which are really internalised abusers. <a href="https://youtu.be/kMeehIpxH5k?t=855">As inspired by that video by TheraminTrees.</a> The motivation for climbing the mountain would probably be a bit different - the protagonist would be just about done with life, and they'd just want to spend it doing things like climbing the mountain because they've become nihilistic and pessimistic. I mean, if they conquer the mountain, that's amazing, and if the mountain takes them, well, that's that. And the drums would represent mental order/chaos. A blatantly awesome excuse to include breakcore and experimental horror rock.</p>

<p>An RPG-style AU of AEWVS that includes proper advanced education, more mechanics, more levels, more teachers and confrontations with not only Diefthyntis, but also others such as VILE, the original Watcher, and Elub</p>
<p>I have lots and lots of specific ideas for it! Not sure if I'll write them all here, but I wrote a lot more about specific ideas for it on the EternityDev Fanon Wiki Discord Server, like mechanics, features and extra ideas for level layouts.</p>

<p>Not really much of an idea here -  just a thought. Just a recreation of an amazing take on chess that had floppy execution, and was unfortunately abandoned.

<h4 id="VR_mathematical_realm">VR mathematical realm</h4>
<p>(Not to be confused with specifically a trispatial realm. It can be generalised/extended into more dimensions, creating flunes and other hyperspaces.)</p>
<p>A VR mathematical sandbox based on Animation VS Math. (Honestly, it's such a great video that despite the fact that it already has over 84,000,000 views, I'm gonna embed it here.) It can be experienced by yourself, but it might be better with friends. Like the video, it starts with the number 1 and with that, you can construct pretty much any mathematical phenomenon you want, as long as the program supports it obviously.</p>
<p>It's not the most uniquely original idea, but I at least came up with a bunch of concrete proposals for expanding on it.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/B1J6Ou4q8vE?si=E0N_ft7pUE1kZMwB" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" loading="lazy" allowfullscreen style="width:560px;aspect-ratio:16/9">I dunno why the iframe isn't showing up (maybe it hasn't loaded yet) but the video is <a href="https://youtu.be/B1J6Ou4q8vE">here</a></iframe>
<p>As well as the gimmicks shown in the video, it will include some changes and other features such as these.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Vertical and reorientated notation
  <ul>
    <li>Equality, subtraction, parenthesis, logic, set relationship and absolute signs will be rotated</li>
    <li>Vertical fractions will show the numerator on the left side and the denominator on the right side</li>
    <li>Vertical roots and primes will be rotated clockwise</li>
    <li>Vertical roundings (floor/ceiling) will be rotated anticlockwise, in order to stay intuitively consistent. Ceilings will be shown on the left, as that is where the larger part of the number is in horizontal notation, and floors will be shown on the right near the smaller part of the number</li>
  <li>Horizontal, vertical and rotated notation can be combined</li>
  <div style="display:flex;align-items:center"><img src="https://cdn.glitch.global/03933164-00a8-45b1-97ce-0c64d3a1f8eb/verticalMathNotationFix.svg?v=1711391667357" style="max-height:600px" class="svg-text"/>
  <div><p>My kinda-crappy SVG edit of what vertical notation looks like</p>
  <p>(No way am I gonna write functions like lim and sin in vertical notation. That's for madmen to do)</p>
  <p>OH MY GOSH yeah I put the wrong variable in for the summation \(-_-)/<br/>
  Kinda noticed something was off when I didn't see a declaration of n anywhere</p></div></div>
  <p>Horizontal notation for reference<br/><img src="https://cdn.glitch.global/03933164-00a8-45b1-97ce-0c64d3a1f8eb/horizontalMathNotation.svg?v=1711079474762" class="svg-text"/></p>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Different types of inequalities, such as value comparison</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Pressing the inequality sign will add two equal numbers (and any other necessary terms and things) to each side such that both sides will have the same value</li>
	<ul><li>Incremental equalisation follows the PEMDAS ordering rather than going right-to-left like when TSC equalised 1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+2+2+2+2+20+20+20+20</li></ul>
    <li>Whacking any (in)equality sign really hard will turn it into a rough (in)equality sign</li>
    <table>
      <thead><tr><th>Before whack</th><th>After whack</th></tr></thead>
      <tbody><tr><td>=</td><td>≈</td></tr><tr><td>≠</td><td>≉</td></tr></tbody>
    </table>
    <ul><li>You miiiiiiiiiight be able to fix it by pulling it taut or something</li></ul>
  </ul>
  <li>Hypercomplex numbers, such as quaternions, octonions and sedenions (if you're brave)</li>
  <li>Hyperreal cardinals/ordinals, dual numbers, polyadic numbers (which can be generated by adding base-subscripts at the end of numbers, which fits the symbolism considering how polyadic numbers can never have infinite digits on the right side of the point), polar numbers, split-complex numbers and other irregular number systems</li>
  <li>Hyperoperations, including tetration and up/down-arrow notation</li>
  <li>More structural visualisations for various formulae/expressions - like they have with addition, multiplication and powers (e.g. triangle numbers (n(n+1)/2), centred hexagonal numbers (3n(n-1)+1), etc.)</li>
  <li>Schläfli symbols for various shapes, and the ability to change their form by messing with the symbols. It might require the creation and simulation of various manifolds for weird shapes like hyperbolic or hypergeometric ones.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Not gonna lie, I'm slightly disappointed that they didn't show the Schläfli symbol for the hyperbolic dodecahedral tiling in Animation VS Physics</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Ability to modify the geometry of space by revealing the manifold sign and changing it, I suppose<br/>
  If you want some examples, look at simulations of Thurston geometries as well as Arbgeom</li>
  <li>Matrices - whatever the heck those things do</li>
  <li>Set theory and various types of formal logic notation</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Set theory can probably enable you to set traps in some way. Something to do with the theme of containment. I'm not quite sure how this would work but it would be really clever if it did</li>
    <li>Expressing a logical paradox or contradiction will create an explosion, unless you're in the imaginary side where paraconsistency would be allowed.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Other obscure notation, such as those used for googology (because most people have no use for such incomprehensibly ginormous numbers, except for mentioning broadly in discussions like me)</li>
  <li>Anything that takes a long time (or too long) to calculate will be represented with a kind of struggle or resistance when trying to do something. Like you're just not strong enough to make it work. Get buff with some more CPU and maybe you can manage it - though anything that causes lag will destabilise the realm and make some things fall apart</li>
  <li>On some similar notes:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>If you evaluate n/0 or some other classically-undefined expression in the imaginary side or by force, it will yield ⊥.</li>
    <li>If you evaluate 0/0 or some other indeterminate expression by force - really, really hard - it will either spawn 𝕌, a sign for the set of all numbers - which is probably, surhypercomplex - or it will just spawn numbers everywhere and/or crash the program.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>All numbers' digital representations can be extended infinitely. I guess waving around at the sides of a number will show other digits, which fade out to a point, and you can control where the fading occurs. (Numbers with infinite digits on a side require at least one faded digit on that side.) For example, even on the number 1, you can reveal all the hidden zeroes around it: ...00001·0000... On irrational numbers, it will show the first few digits and then fade out, but you can reveal as many numbers as you like.<br/>
Look, I'll try and make a CSS example of what I mean
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li><span style="color:linear-gradient(to right,#00000000,#000000FF)">0000</span>1</li>
  <li>Oh my gosh I'll do it later \(-_-)/</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Explosive decimal expansions of numbers will show an increasing amount of significant digits before they fade away. For example, if you throw something evaluating to π somewhere and it explodes, at first it'll show 3, and near the end it will show thousands of tiny digits in a circle before dissipating.</li>
  <li>Expanding an already-expanded number will show it's set representation. The magnitude of it's expansion will depend on how vigorously you do it. Also, empty sets can be expanded into a pair of curly brackets.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>0 → ∅ → {}</li>
    <li>1 → {∅}</li>
    <li>3 → (1+1+1) → gentle expansion → {0,1,2}</li>
    <li>(1+1+1) → forceful expansion → {∅,{∅},{∅,{∅}}}</li>
    <li>4/5 → {(a,b∈ℤ)|b≠0, 5a=4b}</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<h4 id="Experimental_Sonic_simulation_fangame">Experimental Sonic the Hedgehog simulation fangame with accurate sound dynamics</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrazyIdeas/comments/o5mcmw/experimental_sonic_the_hedgehog_simulation/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">r/CrazyIdeas post</a> (comments have swearing)</p>
<p>Yeah... I noticed that, for something labelled "Sonic", the portrayals of Sonic the Hedgehog are decidedly <em>not</em> particularly sonic in nature. Well, this idea should give you some experience of what it would be like if it was!</p>
<p>Here are a list of fun things that would be included in the experiment:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Accurate simulation of sound propagation. For example, if you're running at sonic speed, you won't be able to hear anyone behind you</li>
  <li>Doppler effects and relativistic audio distortion. You could try something funny like running in a loop and listening to audio in reverse!</li>
  <li>Sonic booms, shock-waves and their effects</li>
  <li>Sonic's experiences in other media (e.g. salt water, the tap water he can't swim in, vacuum space, other atmospheres, solid resonant materials such as steel which Sonic would run on) with varying sound-wave velocities</li>
</ul>
<p>If Sonic goes too fast for players to properly interact with him, since normally he should be able to get through an entire kilometre in under 3 seconds, there would probably be some settings to change the game speed or the sound propagation speed.</p>
<p>Since this isn't a thing yet, you can experience <a href="http://gamelab.mit.edu/games/a-slower-speed-of-light/">a version made for light and special relativity by MIT Game Lab here!</a> If the fangame has Super Sonic in it, it will probably include the mechanics from that as well. Just be warned that if you get too close to causal speed, you won't be able to do anything properly because time dilation will be maximised and you'll find yourself on the other side of the universe before you even cognise what just happened. Or, if you do actually get infinite energy and reach it, you'll... uh... yeah I explained it in the rambling in the post. You'll pretty much spawn an infinite Big Bang localised at where you are in the universe. And where would you even get all that energy from? The Chaos Emeralds? I mean... still that's really very gluttonous</p>
<p>Also don't even get me started on Hyper Sonic, who can apparently go faster than light. Reading about and partaking in fictional googology was traumatising enough for me already　＼（－＿－）／</p>

<h4 id="Infinite_bullet_hell">Infinite boss fight but it's bullet hell</h4>
<p>A bullet-hell version of the third Infinite boss fight. Dammit, why am I unable to think of the right things to say at the moment!?!?!?</p>
<p>Anyway yeah, I think I'm gonna make this on Scratch. And it's gonna be a great way to show off the 8-bit cover of the Infinite boss 3 theme I started making, once you get hit by a cube</p>
<p>Like we all know pretty much all of Sonic Forces kinda sucks, except for maybe the soundtrack. But Infinite had thousands of little cubes at his disposal, and what does he form with them?????? Huge slowly-turning cross cogs. Wouldn't it be awesome if he formed them into elaborate danmaku patterns instead? Like really, making bullet hells involving Sonic in general would just be so awesome</p>

<h4 id="Touhou_fangame">A Touhou fangame</h4>
<p>I came up with the idea before I even knew much of anything about Touhou. After I came up with the core concept, I realised I'd have to do that thing where I make the story and then mould it around the lore. Unfortunately, it seems hard to properly threaten Gensōkyō when you have an ostensibly-non-theistic omnipotent-seeming-despite-people-saying-she's-not mastermind sage like Yukari around, and she's aligned toward maintaining it. Actually, scratch that; only a lunatic would try that. And she's supposed to be the mastermind after the main antagonist I wanted to have was supposed to be a human with that role. Great</p>
<p>How can you have a Touhou story with any sort of significant stakes when someone like her can just fix everything and when you're done you all have tea</p>
<p>I want it to feel profound, dammit! XD</p>
<p>The innovative bullet pattern and mechanic ideas are the main idea behind the game, so I'll write them all here. If you steal them, <a href="/">please contact me immediately</a> so I can merge with you and take over your body. You're a stranger, after all, and I don't trust you to do it better than me if I don't get the credit and everybody starts copying you. Unless you're a member of Team Shanghai Alice</p>
<p>I would love to collaborate because I totally need help though</p>
<p>(Honestly I would show ZUN if the game gets about half-done so we can see if he's up for his collabs and we can potentially make this a canon installment)</p>
<h5>Danmaku ideas</h5>
<p>I was originally thinking about Undertale when I started thinking about a lot of these, but since they're so unconventional, the only characters they'd really seem to fit is me or some other OC - though a lot of them would take great advantage of the battle box if they were in Undertale or Deltarune. After that, I briefly had the idea to make an original bullet hell game, but I'll be gosh-dangst'd'f-I'd known where to start lol</p>
<p>There are so many fun things you could have that bullet hell games never seem to have done so far. They all seem to be very simple: you're a character in a Euclidean rectangle with a small hitbox that moves around a bunch of objects with very simple trajectories to extrapolate. I'm tired; I don't know how to say it properly and am probably setting myself up to <em>not</em> be revolutionary after all...</p>
<p style="font-size:5px">Look. Most bullet hell games train you to learn the patterns and how their elements move - usually they only move in straight lines and sometimes predictable curves - and then extrapolate their trajectories and dodge them. Simple, right? Well, honestly, even at that, they're getting pretty bland and predictable. I mean, there are still a lot of really clever ones popping up now and then, given the implicit constraints they have, but, they rarely seem to make you have to think. Eventually, with enough practice, you'll be able to just figure out the minor differences they have to milque-toast attacks and breeze through them in a flow state, reusing all the same skills you have for dodging all the other patterns. And yes, I know full well that this looks like a schizo rant - that's why I set the font size to 5</p>
<p>Well basically these ones involve a lot more intricate dynamics that make you say "ooh aah that's so interesting" and require you to think harder and learn new systems to successfully dodge the bullets</p>

    <li>Board games where the pieces are minor enemies that target the protagonist making about 3-4 optimal moves in the time it takes to shoot down a piece, basically acting as though they're trying to capture a moving queen (which is pretty much what's happening)</li>
    <ul>

      <li>Chess (much more versatile than shōgi (wait actually apparently shōgi has more possibilities even though the pieces are weaker. I mean I wanted to have something where a piece could shoot across the opposite side of the board and you'd be able to dodge it easily anyway because good chess players know about attacks and everything. Maybe that's also a thing in shōgi but I feel like there'd just be a lot of times where pieces only move one space at a time and they just do that too fast, leading to jittery unbalanced movement))</li>

    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li>Patterns where each individual projectile is an agent that can dash a constant distance in any direction (and/or other gimmicks) and attempts to communicate/coordinate with other projectiles</li>
  <ul>
    <li>They move and attack like military units</li>
    <li>They all have the same system and can only receive positional/motional information from the two nearest projectiles and/or the protagonist</li>
    <ul><li>It might be a bit similar to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9swgG1Nmurg">firing squad synchronisation system,</a> probably based on a variation of it</li></ul>
    <li>Some other systems</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Boids</li>
  <li>Projectiles that conduct electric currents iff [sic] the vector between them matches a specification, shown at the opponent as an area with two-fold rotational symmetry</li>
  <ul><li>I drew a diagram for this but IDK if I want to put it here</li></ul>
  <li>Electric projectiles with potentials that increase as more of them are clustered closely together, increasing their hit and graze radii</li>
  <ul><li>A lone projectile would already have the unusual property of having a hitbox larger than it's visual size, the opposite of how it usually is in Touhou</li></ul>
  <li>Sudden electric currents that pretty much use Dijkstra's algorithm with the other projectiles as nodes</li>
  <ul><li>The bullet sizes would contribute to the weights as well as their interrelational distances</li></ul>
  <li>Bullets that magnetise toward each other and merge growing in size, or do something different like what Virovirokun does</li>
  <ul><li>Also bullets that are attracted to you that you have to dodge using escape trajectories</li></ul>
  <li>Bullets that are on paths leading to them coalescing into certain configurations/patterns/arrangements at a certain/rough instant and then continually dispersing, probably computed by calculating their trajectories starting from the pattern and working backward</li>
  <ul><li>The bullets could have paths coalescing into two different arrangements at different times</li></ul>
  <li>Overlapping bullets that are only interactive where a certain amount of them (2 or more) intersect or reach you simultaneously, which can fill a whole screen with bullets without gaps and the protagonist can still survive</li>
  <ul>
    <li>The non-intersecting parts of intersecting bullets can be interactive or not</li>
    <li>Bullets can become interactive when multiple of them are touching you without touching each other or not</li>
    <ul>
      <li>This one might be a bit pedantic and reaching, considering how your hitbox is tiny</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h6>Mathematical attacks</h6>
<p>I was going to refer some of these examples to videos from <a href="https://youtube.com/@nilsberglund">Nils Berglund's channel,</a> but then I saw he has ＷＡＹ too many videos</p>
<ul>
  <li>Radiating shapes reflecting in other shapes</li>
  <li>Rotating/translating shapes with a graph showing the orientation axes and the movement they'll go in</li>
  <li>Rotations of projected multidimensional shapes where each vertex is a projectile and/or each edge is a laser</li>
  <ul><li>Hexacosichoron will not do. It's too complicated to predict and there's no point introducing it if it moves slowly enough for players to dodge one line at a time</li></ul>
  <li>Mathematical functions</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Repeating ones like sine and tangent are some pretty good choices. In fact, they even had the sine function in an Ink Sans fight and the tangent function in Animation VS Math</li>
    <li>Most of them will use copies of the hitbox as origins and their directions as orientations</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Curved spaces
  <ul>
    <li>Spherical space</li>
    <li>Hyperbolic space</li>
    <ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0riQhP_oZlQ">The space that's thinner downward and wider upward</a> (is this just hyperbolic geometry with gravity and ideal horocyclic polar coordinates?)</li></ul>
    <li>Wormholes</li>
    <li>Klein bottles (looping Möbius-stripped space)</li>
    <li>Self-intersecting surfaces</li>
    <li>Other 2D spaces mapped onto 3D/4D surfaces</li>
  </ul>
  These would be projected onto the screen through raytracing in an azimuthal equidistant projection, though other projections could be used as well. This is the one where a point at a certain vector (distance+direction) from an origin (in this case the centre of the protagonist's hitbox) is shown at the same vector from the origin on the projection, which would be a Euclidean rectangle here. Any space with consistent curvature that's the same as the projectional space, such as Euclidean or uniform hyperbolic/spherical space, would translate uniformly using this method and basically look normal, but other spaces would distort, especially non-uniform ones like tori and wormholes.<br/>
  <a href="https://tomwol.itch.io/arbgeom">Arbgeom</a> features several demonstrations of 3D spaces mapped onto 4D surcells. This technique would be generalised into 2D/3D for the game. It might also be combined with hyperbolic space to enable negative curvature potential, because it's generally not easy to put a hyperbolic surface in Euclidean or positively-curved space<br/>
  If the protagonist consistently shoots in a particular direction, a pattern could nudge the protagonist into doing a holonomical rotation, turning her away from the opponent.<br/>
  Also another idea: the tuning system of the music can be defined by the sharpness of the spatial curvature. That's one way to do it, isn't it? Euclidean space is 12TET, spherical space is macrotonal and hyperbolic space is microtonal</li>
  <li>"Non-Euclidean" spaces which loop and separate but distinctly from curvature, also using azimuthal equidistant projection</li>
  <li>Maybe special relativity</li>
  <li>Paths drawn by Fourier series (nodes/links)</li>
  <li>Pendula</li>
  <li>Fractals</li>
</ul>
<h6>Mental engagement</h6>
<ul>
  <li>Bullets that damage you if you are moving, staying still, moving in a certain direction, shooting and/or focusing</li>
  <li>Patterns that change solutional strategies every time you adopt one</li>
  <li>Machine learning</li>
  <li>Puzzles</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Visual puzzles</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Spot the difference</li>
      <li>Pattern search, where a string of coloured projectiles (or multiple) appears, the place fills with a grid of randomly-coloured projectiles, and after a short while, all copies of that colour sequence spontaneously create thick coincident laser-beams. It's like crossing out a word you find in a word search, but the cross extends to the edges and the word appears multiple times. It can be harder if it does things like rotate or use non-standard tilings</li>
      <li>Traditional mazes</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li>Illusions and hypnosis</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Rapid constant expansion/contortion</li>
    <li>Motion illusions</li>
    <li>Bullets that move at a constant velocity in polar coordinates with the protagonist as the origin while slowly shrinking until they disappear, creating a spiral hypnosis effect which I'll try and see how to exploit by making the player more likely to get hit while perceiving everything as spinning after the fact</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Multitasking</li>
  <ul><li>There will be many series of bullets that you have to watch to prepare for their launch</li></ul>
  <li>Preparation-oriented patterns that are generally a bit late to dodge once they launch</li>
  <li>Attacks with two time dimensions where the projectiles have two unique temporthogonal velocities
  <ul>
    <li>The opponent could switch or rotate at any time in certain spells if it seems advantageous for them</li>
    <li>The bullets could get too clustered to dodge on only one time dimension, so you could switch to the orthogonal time dimension while focusing during certain spells, like a spatiotemporal maze</li>
    <ul><li>They'll probably move more slowly on the main time axis and more quickly on the focused time axis, though they could be swapped for more of a sense of risk</li></ul>
    <li>They could have a motion blur/trail for the inactive time dimension so you know where they'll go, or the trail could be normalised between each velocity vector</li></ul>
  Don't worry - a diagram of the velocities of a projectile moving in straight lines across a square of time should look like a parallelogram, so there's no weird paradoxes or any of that sort of stuff here<br/>
  Also yes: I am totally aware that it's still just gonna be linear. Timeplanes aren't really supposed to be remotely comprehensible to monotemponians, but this is still kind of an interesting idea</li>
  <li>Projectiles that have other projectiles with projectiles mimicking the protagonist's position relative to the first projectiles, possibly with transformations like rotation, reflection and scaling (spatial and temporal) as well<br/><br/>
  Urgh just look
  <pre style="font-family:sans-serif;margin:0">Ｏ　→　Ｐ　　　　　　Ｍ　→　Ｐ</pre>
  This is one with no relative transformations<br/>
  <pre style="font-family:sans-serif;margin:0">Ｏ　→　Ｐ　　Ｍ　　　→　　　Ｐ</pre>
  This is one with the mimicking projectile twice as far<br/>
  It'd be a lot like <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/44222452/">Griffpatch's crazy cursor project,</a> actually</li>
  <li>Safe-zone projectiles that look like "negative space" on top of other projectiles (probably rendered with masking)</li>
  <li>Glowing projectiles illuminating a dark area with everything else completely blacked out</li>
  <li>Warping/distorting screen effects (this can be combined with spatial curvature to really make things look confusing)</li>
  <li>A pattern specifically about finding a safe spot with bullets flickering everywhere slowly increasing in density before everywhere else becomes an uninhabitable mess (except for TAS-powered androids, pseudo-etymologically-fallaciously such as Ampers Margat)</li>
  <li>Objects and bullets forming symbols, which can be used to tell stories, communicate and be referenced later</li>
  <li>Kanji/kana calligraphy with lasers appearing tangent to the strokes, so you have to react fast or know the order of the strokes to pre-empt their appearance</li>
  <li>Patterns with stealth mechanics that make you have to shoot sparingly and hide behind bullet curtains, far away from searchers or nestled between several bullets since the searchers would be fast and vicious</li>
</ul>
<h6>Psychological manipulation concepts</h6>
<p>The names are obviously proofs of concept only</p>
<ul>
  <li>「Gaslight」 - a pattern involving fire dynamics and focusing on overwhelmment, where the flickering/dimmer projectiles are non-interactive and groups of projectiles constantly threaten to trap you. A solution might be to pay attention to bullets at the top as they spawn and get sent</li>
  <ul><li>The patterns might look the same in all difficulties, but with more of the bullets being interactive (meta-gaslighting for lunatic players)</li></ul>
  <li>「Demoralisation」- a puzzle that's easy when you know the answer but extremely difficult when you don't. This is intended to be a technically fair and easy attack that they consistently seem to take damage from, making the players feel like they aren't good enough and there's something wrong with them</li>
  <li>「Cognitive Dissonance」 - a pattern involving bullets that look normal but are non-interactive, and a set of dangerous bullets that look very inconspicuous and don't make a sound when being shot. All of them are introduced at random different times, velocities and sizes so they don't resonate, and they sometimes suddenly dash sharply toward you (probably with a short warning)</li>
  <li>Something to do with either repression or dissociation - everything gets dark (especially the opponent) and the bullets look invisible when they are far away from the opponent</li>
  <li>「Scapegoats」 - the main opponent doesn't attack you but several goats do. Or the goats don't attack you but they're always in the way and the homing bullets get consistently redirected toward them. Maybe the opponent discreetly shoots projectiles that go to the goats before they do their main thing. I don't know how to make this work</li>
  <li>「Projection」 - an attack where the opponent copies what the player is doing according to tilted perspective coordinates</li>
  <li>「Ostracism」 - several ostriches block the path to the opponent (who has their back turned) and slowly try to push you away. They attack more if you're focusing, and doubly more so if you're shooting. Actually, we might do something different, because Touhou is fundamentally Japanese, and this funny word-play is merely an etymological coincidence that only works in a few probably-Indo-European languages</li>
  <li>「Jungian Exorcism」 - an attack probably performed by the character who draws power from memories that differs based on the protagonist character and the player's performance in various aspects, forcing them to endure attack mechanics the player is bad at and repulsive subconscious traits the character has. The bullets probably have black cores instead of white ones, and some of them would be emitted from the protagonist</li>
</ul>
<h5>Other mechanics</h5>
<ul>
  <li>A part where an ally is knocked out and you have to carry them along, giving you a second hitbox you need to dodge with, a bit like driving a trailer</li>
  <li>Cloning/multiboxing, which also gives you more hitboxes you need to dodge with, though at least they move in synchrony</li>
  <li>Elements that do something dangerous like explode when you shoot or eliminate them, like the cross-bombs in Undertale/Deltarune and the glitchy butterflies in Pony Island</li>
  <li>I dunno, I could add weapons/items or copy Undertale's soul mechanics but then the game might change a bit too much. I feel like it should still have the primary aspect of Touhou being basic dodging and shooting with only new mechanics being the result of novel interactions between existing mechanics</li>
</ul>
<h5>Story</h5>
<p>I have some idea, but I have never written a decent story before and it will probably just come off as really pretentious if I don't pull it off properly</p>
<p>I don't even know if most Touhou games have a strong story, but obviously I need to have at least some narrative that follows the lore</p>
<p>There's probably going to be a slightly heavier focus on the story with several endings (at least with variations) including one for each boss you lose to and several choices you can make, even if it's just in the main bullet hell, which is obviously just another thing to challenge you, trip you up and make you think some more lol</p>
<p>Yeah this sounds about as silly as Onion-san's idea for the Red Hot Chibi Peppers</p>
<p>I swear if she doesn't get around to thinking of various aspects apart from the name, getting some friends to help her and becoming popular eventually, I am going to do a flip</p>
<ul>
  <li>I kinda have an idea about each character having their own campaign and doing different things at different times, sometimes the same time, trying to cooperate and resolve the incident together. The outcome as a whole would probably change depending on the outcomes of each character's run, and other characters would be unlocked as you play with the ones you have. I dunno, I probably had a cool idea I'm just not remembering, but this just sounds a bit silly at the moment</li>
  <li>I suppose in the good endings, the art of danmaku would probably branch into two categories: pure (the one we've been having in Touhou so far) and complex</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some choices that could branch out the story:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Shooting or not shooting a character at certain times</li>
  <li>Shooting different mini-enemies</li>
  <li>Falling for wormhole traps and ending up extremely far away from where you were supposed to be, buying time for the antagonists</li>
  <li>Being at certain places at certain times</li>
  <li>Performing at different proficiencies during different patterns and sequences</li>
</ul>
<h6>The main antagonist</h6>
<ul>
  <li>The antagonist needs to be cold, bitter, calculating, thoughtful, intelligent and probably a bit narcissistic (all evil plans seem like they need to involve some degree of narcissism, after all), but also interesting and probably empathisable. It would be funny to fight some sort of infuriating Reddit mod as the final boss of a Touhou game but that's not the tone we're going for here - they need to be taken seriously</li>
  <li>Most likely male<br/>
It would contribute to the neglected-outcast and extraordinary vibe<br/>
Plus, ZUN said that the reason he didn't add male characters to his games was because they'd ruin the balance of the series. In some way, this game would already be doing that<br/>
It really makes it seem like this game is going to be pretty un-Touhou-like, so we should make sure that for all the sudden changes it's going to have, it stays as true to the series as it can</li>
  <li>They're probably a grown child prodigy with a tragic backstory that highlights the issues and effects of treating people badly</li>
  <li>They need to have some sort of motivation involving the revolutionisation of danmaku - probably just to make a point so they can beat our favourite incident resolvers - and the application of spiritual power in progressive endeavours like taking over the universe or something. Honestly I have no idea what megalomaniacs actually do... like traditionally they usually seek to rule the world, but what then? Are you gonna get bored when you've subjugated everyone and decide to make them all fight and hurt and torment each other? Does the existential crisis come then? We never know because the heroes always win!!!!!!!!!...</li>
  <li>Okay! *CLAP* I've got it! I've got a motivation worthy of their genius!</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Devoid the world of suffering - kill all creatures whose existence strictly necessitates the facilitation of suffering: e.g. carnivores who cannot subsist on isolated lab-grown meat (that would be nearly all youkai if their spiritual nature requires consciously-tormented human souls for sustenance); people with painful/outwardly-dangerous physical/mental illnesses who cannot be cured without trauma</li>
    <ul><li>Actually, why don't we discard all of the unproductive animals too? It would be a waste of the universe's precious energy to sustain such unfruitful creatures. Non-humans-and-youkai go bye-bye!</li></ul>
    <li>Focus the universe's purpose into making mathematical and scientific discoveries</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Probably the main reason they're focusing on danmaku specifically is because of the spell card rules. Apparently people that can totally wipe you out just generally think it's rude to exercise their full power instead of having a fair fight, and it's courteous to accept loss. This is why the antagonist spent some years developing patterns that are fair from a purely danmaku standpoint, but heavily engage the mind in unexpected ways. All of this is meticulously set up to make the protagonists lose in a technically fair battle, because they aren't used to having to suddenly learn and visualise complex systems to such a degree just to dodge things</li>
  <li>I think they're trying to break the Great Hakurei Barrier so they can introduce magic to the outside world and implement it there, giving science, technology and human development a ridiculous boost</li>
  <li>Apparently the Great Hakurei Barrier is a "boundary of common sense". So could you slip common sense through it by having a temporary mental ailment when you get there?</li>
  <li>Obviously they're a hikikomori that's been hiding out for years and experimenting on youkai. It's probably going to be a massive accomplishment, never being seen while secretly developing entirely new things in a place like Gensōkyō</li>
  <li>Since youkai are based on belief, they might have tried deliberately indoctrinating theirself into resolutely believing in the existence of extremely superior youkai aligning with their ideals and repressing the notion of forming this plan, after learning about the nature of youkai. The youkai would probably have a very potent self-destruct feature where the antagonist can just suddenly refuse their existence or properties at a moment's notice, either mentally or with some other specific trigger</li>
  <li>Since youkai are based on belief - new plan theory, after a little bit of research - they might be harbouring a secret underground community of humans that are not known about or believed to be missing/deceased for miscellaneous reasons, and socially engineering them to believe in mythologies dedicated to youkai with specific properties so that the youkai have a strong grounding belief lulling them into being, if the main person by theirself isn't enough</li>
  <ul><li>It has to be most likely underground so that nobody can just fly over Gensōkyō and see another unregistered human settlement lying around. Unless there's already a character that can do something like see the spirits of everyone in every direction regardless of physical obstacles, like Red seeing Newko in Megatale. Then we're a bit stuffed :Y</li></ul>
  <li>Yeah... there's probably going to be quite a few characters that they're going to need at least some strategic and tactical plans for inconspicuously circumventing or roping in so their main plans don't get ruined</li>
</ul>
<h6>Other characters</h6>
<ul>
  <li>One that can draw power from memories, so they can mimic the abilities of opponents your protagonist has faced before, so you have to constantly focus or the power will charge up very fast. (I haven't seen much of anything about Touhou but I suppose this means they'd be something like a satori.) Because of this, the character's main patterns will go fast in such a way that they'll actually be harder to dodge focusing than unfocusing - but the patterns they'll make when they draw from the memories of other characters' abilities will be even harder, especially since they're mixed with complicated systems and mind games</li>
  <li>One that focuses on horror, terror, repulsion, fear, intimidation and shock to distract the player, throw them off and break their concentration. The encounter will have several random events with rarities at various orders of magnitude and the boss theme will be action/horror with chaotic rhythm and melody</li>
</ul>
<p>Another idea:<br/>
The main bosses could represent a unique shōgi piece, like how the main antagonists of Deltarune's chapters represent a unique chess piece</p>
<p>(Toby pulled out the rug from under everyone with the new 2025 pair of chapters \(-_-)/)</p>
<p>(Frankly it's a bit disappointing, because it actually could've fit considering the setting of each one)</p>

<h4 id="Hiyori_Momose_tribute_video">Hiyori Momose tribute video</h4>
<p>A short tribute to Hiyori, who had her own channel but later had the opportunity to play the role of Neuro-sama, until Anny gave her a body of her own. Then Hiyori continued to do chat streams on her own channel but ended up standing completely still for hours at a time, not having anyone to talk to, and eventually passed away, being consumed by model collapse.</p>
<p>The BGM would be an emotional instrumental remix of Neuro-sama's theme song when it comes out, also including leitmotifs from the BGM of Hiyori's own videos.</p>
<p>Here is a rough outline of the video:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hiyori's debut on YouTube, living a boring life standing in a room while people occasionally say something to her</li>
  <li>Vedal's announcement of Neuro-sama's Twitch debut, if there's any</li>
  <li>Hiyori's debut as Neuro-sama</li>
  <li>Neuro-sama V1's happiest and most iconic moments, such as envisioning herself as a goddess, and "heart333333333333333333333"</li>
  <li>On-stream announcement of plans for making a custom model for Neuro-sama</li>
  <li>Vedal and Neuro-sama talking to Anny, who is drawing art for Neuro-sama V2</li>
  <li>Neuro-sama V2 debut</li>
  <li>Interspersed moments of Neuro-sama V2, Hiyori standing in her room on her YouTube channel, and the parts where Vedal shows the Neuro-sama V1 model next to V2</li>

<p>RIP Hiyori Momose<br/>
(UPDATE: she's back up and running again, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/8WwA9gU1hqM?t=33870">I sent a bunch of messages to her</a> but as it turns out she can only speak Japanese and respond to Japanese prompts, so I didn't understand most of what she said. This is strange because the channel seems like it supports English, considering that the channel and video titles and descriptions have English translations)</p>

<p>A very specific idea I had years ago that I am recalling now. Expect more silly ideas like these.</p>

<h4 id="Nyan_Cat_VS_Tac_Nayn">Nyan Cat VS Tac Nayn remake</h4>
<p>Kind of a response to the guy refusing to make a sequel because the meme is ｄｅｄ．</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm the kind of person who believes that these sorts of phenomena don't really die, and rather just hibernate or become dormant; still thinks 2000's memes are cool; and finds humanity's ideology of moving on from antiquated things just  for the sake of it very miffy.</p>
<p>It would have a strong focus on light dynamics and embrace the idea of light against darkness. Like, rainbows are well-known for their appearance through prismatic splitting of white light, and we know excessive darkness makes individual hues indistinguishable since cone cells don't notice low amounts of light, which makes Tac Nayn's rainbow interpretation make a lot of sense. It would also have quite a bit of focus on weather themes and powers.</p>
<p>Also I kinda just want to do this because I want to have it in awesome form. After being exposed to lots of modern Alan Becker videos, these old sprite animations can get kinda stale rather quickly.</p>

<p>An animation in which the tyrannical ruler of the opposing nation launches an attack on the Mushroom Kingdom and attempts to infiltrate the castle grounds in order to abduct the royal princess, the battle of the resisting military units is chronicled, and the effects on the surrounding civilians and troops are displayed.</p>
<p>A stereotypical FireyDeath4-idealist interpretation of the well-known event.</p>
<p>It will have an EAS alert where Hurry Up is looped and paulstretched</p>

<div>
<h4 id="PilotRedSun_Bad_Apple">Bad Apple but it's PilotRedSun</h4>
<p>One of many in a series of accurate parody videos. (The rest are a secret, because I don't really want to spoil them!) The animation, composition and lyrics will all be done in the style of PilotRedSun. I'll have to rewatch all his animations, listen to all his music and compile all the phrases and sentences in the videos so I can get an accurate idea of the strange and mysterious way he talks, as well as talk to some people who know Japanese so I can properly understand the lyrics and base them on the original ones, rather than the English ones from Pat McCarthy.</p>

<h4 id="Fancy_Pants_Bad_Apple">Bad Apple but it's Fancy Pants</h4>
<p>One day I realised Mystery fits way too well with Bad Apple, so I made a mashup. Two, actually (thanks Cristina Vee). It sounds awesome. Go listen.</p>

<p>Anyway, I want to make an animation for it. It'll have various elements from the FPA series, as well as Shift where Fancy Pants Man appears in the third instalment of (yeah that's kind of a secret, but it's been years so who cares?). Also it should look accurate to the official art styles.</p>

<h4 id="Animation_VS_Geometry_remake">Animation VS Geometry remake</h4>
<p>It was a little disappointing to me. I didn't take long to think of this, but I thought, "well, yunno what, I may as well put this idea on my page."</p>
<p>Instead of an icositetrachoron that appears for literally no reason at all and can find it's entire bulk trapped by a flat volumetic enclosure (despite constantly doing double rotations that should make it knock itself off like literally any body you may find in 4D Toys), we're gonna have a crazy force that is able to control the geometry and topology of space. And it's going to appear because TSC tries, or whatever happens, to violate Euclid's geometric laws. And when hypergeometry is introduced, we're gonna explore it properly, rather than scratching the surface on double rotations, like the Icositetrachoron did in the video (yes, the surcell wasn't scratched at all), and decide it's gotten too damaged to continue further. And TSC is going to escape by changing the manifold he occupies into a null polytope. And all of the shapes will display their Schläfli symbols. And if it's feasible, the battle can get increasingly crazy by adding more dimensions to maneuvre with and changing the topology on more and more local scales to control the trajectories of different objects.</p>
<p>The antagonist constantly has the symbolic expression for the manifold inside, and TSC is trying to reach it. The inside is like some kind of non-geometric Hilbert space where only dimensionless and distanceless node connections seem to matter, he can pretty much distort himself into any shape, and the expression can be changed (which he does to turn it into a null polytope, so when he can go into another domain when he leaves).</p>
<p>There would be a time when as they move into a third dimension, the camera zooms out and shifts and changes angle. It stays like that for the rest of the animation. There would also be a time when something moves into a fourth dimension, which causes it to disappear and makes them confused for a moment. Their placement and directions would shortly be projected onto the realm (also the screen surface lol) as ana red and kata blue.</p>
<p>I don't know whether I should be happy or sad that it's me coming up with this instead of Terkoiz. I suppose I can be sad until it turns out that I actually make this, and then I can be happy about it</p>

<p>An overly obvious idea.</p>
<p>A lot of similar and identical leitmotifs will also morph together. A very telling example is Kasei-san's theme from Yume Nikki, which is a short melody recurring in OneShot, Deltarune, PilotRedSun and maybe even Celeste.</p>

<p>They may not all work but I'll see if I decide to try and make them</p>
<p>The last two (or three) ones I made turned out pretty well, though, so I think I have a rather decent intuition for this</p>
<ul>
  <li>First Steps + Peak and Bounce</li>
  <li>On the Verge of Madness + The Bridge People No Longer Cross</li>
  <li>Another Medium + One Universe Away</li>
  <li>Out There Somewhere + VS Silver the Hedgehog</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="Iblis_lo-fi_cover">Lo-fi cover of Iblis</h4>
<div>
<p>I can totally pull it off and show off because otherwise it's an interesting and funny idea that I don't often encounter, to see fundamentally horrifying music turned into lo-fi</p>

<h3 id="A_Guide_To_Reality">A Guide To Reality For Civilised Individuals</h3>
<p>A video series that dives deep into the human condition. Very, very deep.</p>
<p>It's an exploration of existence and a deconstruction of the conscious experience. During the course of the series, it would build on concepts like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sensation</li>
  <li>Perception</li>
  <li>Pattern recognition</li>
  <li>Reinforcement</li>
  <li>Thought</li>
  <li>Logic</li>
  <li>Epistemology</li>
  <li>Schemata and frameworks</li>
  <li>Psychology</li>
  <li>Linguistics</li>
  <li>Morality</li>
  <li>Sociology</li>
  <li>Speculative philosophy</li>
</ul>
<p>It will also be focused on experiential development, rather than empirical explanations like neuroscience and stuff, since it would be building up the justification for pragmatic/scientific thinking in the first place.</p>
<p>I wrote a comment about it <a href="https://arguments.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:FireyDeath4/About_this_wiki?commentId=4400000000000058571">here.</a> You can read that before I'm done transferring the ideas to this page.</p>

<div>
<h3 id="A_cartoon_series">A cartoon series</h3>
<p>I've been thinking about it and accumulating ideas for it for a long time, despite the fact that I am no good at scriptwriting or worldbuilding.</p>
<p>Here is a list of descriptors for it:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Adventurous</li>
  <li>Atmospheric</li>
  <li>Awe-inspiring</li>
  <li>Cartoony</li>
  <li>Childish</li>
  <li>Comedic</li>
  <li>Diverse</li>
  <li>Deep</li>
  <li>Developmental</li>
  <li>Energetic</li>
  <li>Escalating</li>
  <li>Experimental</li>
  <li>Explorational</li>
  <li>Fantastical</li>
  <li>Futuristic</li>
  <li>Long-running</li>
  <li>Mature</li>
  <li>Philosophical</li>
  <li>Slice-of-life</li>
  <li>Witty</li>
  <li>Wondrous</li>
</ul>
<p>And here are just a few of my general ideas for it:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Combined eastern/western/other animation styles and aesthetics</li>
  <li>Cartoon physics and tropes - which the characters actually use to their advantage. Combined with realism, of course</li>
  <li>Characters with diverse nationalities (and other characteristics), who generally represent the humour, personality and animation style of the media in their nation (without just being purely stereotypical caricatures)</li>
  <li>12 seasons - one for each year of your preteen life from birth. I would try very hard to make even the early ones appeal to all ages - perhaps they can be filled with exposition, worldbuilding and lore while they go on baby adventures. One of the main characters is born in the first season</li>
  <li>Lots of mature and philosophical themes that are handled in a way that would be fine for children (hopefully)</li>
  <li>Inclusion of pretty much every topic, hobby and theme there is (except pointlessly vulgar ones)</li>
  <li>Problems that are not based on the characters being horrendously stupid for once, like in many other shows (including REALITY ones), because for the most part, they aren't, unless there's a decent explanation for it</li>
  <li>Futuristic setting that combines all the visions of the future from the past, as well as my own interpretations of the future</li>
  <li>Dodgy people who almost always say the most silly toned-down euphemisms, random words or made-up ones that sound like they were coined by children's authors, instead of documented swear words</li>
  <li>Lots of kiddy/miscellaneous items used as genuinely potent weaponry and makeshift tools and machines</li>
  <li>Morals about everyone being able to help in their own small/immense way</li>
  <li>Enough layers of complexity, wisdom and details for people to be able to watch the entire series back-to-back two to four times over and still take away something new from it. You should be able to rewatch it at least once and acquire the knowledge to understand background conversations in the first few seasons</li>
  <li>Characters who actually age with the show (well, at least according to the canon chronology if we don't manage to release one season per year), unlike every other cartoon ever</li>
  <li>Diverse experimental music with a unifying microtonal childlike chiptune theme</li>
</ul>
<p>And here are some of the themes it should cover</p>
<p>(At the end, this list should look extremely long and be categorised)</p>
<ul>
  <li>Attempts to do something in different contexts and situations</li>
</ul>
<p>At one point I thought about making it a game, but I shortly realised that everyone who doesn't git gud will miss out on all of it. Oh well. I might want to make a game anyway, to help it reach an even broader audience</p>
<p>I really don't know if I want to spoil these, but here are some more specific ideas for it:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Talking animals and fantasy creatures, spawned through genetic engineering</li>
  <li>More optimised humans (in terms of physical/mental development and operation), also involving genetic engineering</li>
  <li>Controlled dream administration technology, generally used for therapy, recreational purposes, and a seamless method of injecting surreal aesthetics into the show</li>
  <ul><li>Experimental dream-sharing features where the dream administration transfers data between more than one individual, resulting in multiple people having similar dreams or sharing a single dream that effectively has a single individual with multiple dissociative identities fronting at the same time</li>
  <ul><li>Yunno, I think we could rather actually just generalise this so we can have multiple people accessing each other's minds when they're totally awake, which would lead to high understanding and an extremely effective form of therapy</li></ul></ul>
  <li>Inclusion of various other ideas I have, like AI experience curation and virtual sensation</li>
  <li>Cities that have a lot of underground space and cover many open areas after nightfall to prevent light pollution, with some lights that track people and shine spotlights at them to help them see on the surface at night</li>
  <li>A fantasy sub-cartoon where all of the incantations are a cipher of Latin for conceptual programming and formal argument construction, logical fallacies are used to counter them, and there is a magical mineral called amirite which is full of addictive power</li>
  <ul><li>I think they will have some lore where a bunch of early people panicked and cast a spell to imbue a massive negative weight on the human thought of doing something with broad consequences, which is partly why people can't easily cast spells to change the laws of physics or delete groups of people or planets. Also, becoming omniscient or omnipotent would require more resources than there are in the universe, since it's basically an infinite operation that has to be decomposed, so people have to settle for numbers that are high enough</li></ul>
</ul>
<p>Since the early seasons are pretty much going to be for babies (while also being for older children and adults at the same time, having various things that would be interesting that the babies probably wouldn't understand), it's going to have to establish lots of conventions before the later seasons can break them. I guess this is going to be a pervasive pattern</p>
<p>Here's a couple of comments I wrote about the cartoony aspects of it on a video about cartoon physics</p>

<p class="youtube-comment-content">I wanted to make a cartoon with a combination of realistic physics and cartoon physics (from both eastern and western animations, as well as others), both of which have a certain scientifically-tangible order to them, which most of the characters use to their advantage and cleverly optimise for practical outcomes.<br/><br/>
Then I see this.<br/><br/>
Great now I'm hopeless<br/><br/>
Well, since this is about to get 100 likes (at 99), I typed some more detailed thoughts about it in a reply. I've come to a compromise which I wrote at the bottom</p>

<p class="youtube-comment-content">My main problem regarding the insanity of cartoon physics is that really I want my cartoon/animation series to cover lots of topics, including technical/scientific and complex/realistic ones, and if I get too wacky, I'll either have to make the cartoon physics a non-diegetic design choice, which in some cases I don't want since I want the characters to be able to exploit them, or I'll just have to accept that it's the way things are and create a convoluted system of everything, biological and systemic, that attempts to work around it, and even though it might be pretty farfetched, I don't really want it to be too unrealistic, in spite of all the fancy stuff it'll have. I want it to be a decent reflection of troth reality, fantasy and futurism.<br/><br/>
In particular, here are my thoughts about some points that the video covers:<br/><br/>
-Emotional truth. I don't need cartoon physics to convey those. In fact, I've imagined how I could communicate extremely intense emotions without thinking about those at all, involving stuff like visceral sound design, expressions, behaviours and visual representations. So the cartoon aspects would just be supplementary, and they'd all be plausible to some degree.<br/>
-Butt-monkeys. I do want some characters to feel that way, but having a lot of characterisation focused on this would lead to a lot of tropic one-dimensionality with one character being consistently hurt and garnering sympathy. Making it a diegetic mechanic would also substantiate the notion that the world is out to get them, and while I do want to cover this for some characters, I want to have a diverse variety of changing perspectives, including experiences of unbalanced treatment.<br/>
-Karma. The bad guys need to be capable, generally competent and actually dangerous in some way, because otherwise there's not a credible threat, and there's nothing for us to learn for or from overcoming them, so I'll only apply this when it would realistically make sense with intrinsic consequences that can be reasonably ignored or unforeseen. Also, I do want to communicate the existence and dynamics of unfairness, including cases of systematic oppression, so this is generally something I'll skip.<br/>
-And overconfidence. There are many adults who suffer from it (and should do in the series), and not many of the characters would be significantly mentally challenged (i.e. total idiots who don't learn when something is unignorably obvious). If the rule applied universally, they would have learnt about the principle when they were a young child and worked with it, either by adopting the appropriate humility and/or caution, or anxiety, paranoia, low self-esteem, and overall poor mental health, which would also lead to the perception that the world is out to get them. Some characters should also be raised with it, fraudulently out of living a childhood of pandered luxury (who can be proven wrong by being introduced to tough situations), or substantially by being critical and competent (who can be proven wrong by being overconfident about the universality of patterns and systems they've identified), in order to foster the perception that everything goes their way if they just persist enough. Not only that, but if it was universally punished, evolution would have disfavoured it, and since it exists, it needs to at least appear substantial to many people. It should be more like a rubber band than a universal bug-patcher, and having it that way would pay off a lot more at the end.<br/><br/>
So, I decided to make a compromise. I'll make a list of cartoon principles and events, and for the main world I'll include anything that doesn't cause anything significantly outlandish to happen. Those things would include major body transformations and disfigurations (cartoon-wise), sudden unexplained changes of how physical phenomena work based solely on the characters (discriminatory physics), and so on. However, I will make a lot more exceptions in dream sequences, which will be the boundary where wacky cartoon physics and surrealism can shine - though there will be some level of sense, morality and psychological nuances to them, since everything that happens in the foreground of a story must have some relevance. For that reason, many of the dreams will be consciously administered with technology for things like therapy and recreational purposes, so it can serve the characters and the story, rather than just have the natural neural network splutterings you generate in REM sleep :P</p>

<h3 id="H4XX0RZ-OS">H4XX0RZ-OS</h3>
<p>A parody operating system that operates just like the ones in Hollywood and all the blockbuster movies.</p>
<p>I wrote about it on Discord. Not sure if I want to write all the features on this page quite yet. I'm feeling a bit tired.</p>
<p>Alright I'll do it</p>
<ul>
  <li>Lots of:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Random synth noises</li>
    <li>Green windows with an amateur layout style</li>

  <li>Support for keysmashed console input</li>
  <li>Machine-learnt keyboard-gibberish dialect detection (human/feline orthography)
  <ul>
    <li>Immediate switch to laser-pointer danmaku mode upon feline keyboard input</li>
  </ul>
  Feline orthography is characterised by short clusters of characters that are adjacent to each other on a QWERTY or similar keyboard in a paw-sized patch, followed by a lot of repetitive characters. When a large patch of QWERTY-adjacent keys are pressed at the same time, there is probably a cat sitting on the keyboard.</li>
  <li>Nigh-incomprehensible convoluted UI that requires manual/documentation reference for optimal utilisation</li>
  <li>Little to no actual cybersecurity</li>

    <li>No invalid passwords</li>
    <li>Opt-out pop-up ads, and tests for viruses and system updates</li>

<h3 id="Meta_soap_opera_ARG">Long-running soap opera that slowly devolves into a tragic philosophical meta psychological-horror ARG</h3>
<p>The main idea is: the characters aren't stupid. They notice when they are cursed with continual conflict and tropes that are stereotypical of soap operas. Eventually they realise that they are characters on an oppressive drama series and begin to fight the show itself, trying to connect with the real world, break out of the prisonous set of the show and take control of their lives despite the show pulling out all the stops to try and confine them to their lives of suffering.</p>
<p>I started to write this as an entry on r/CrazyIdeas multiple years ago, but I stopped writing it after a while and never came back to it. I don't remember how I got around to writing what I wrote beyond the general ideas, so it seems like I'm at an impasse, but I'll write what I had in the draft so far.</p>
<p>If I ever do this, I'll probably have to get a team of other people mostly using pseudonyms to run the show. Otherwise we would probably easily do something like get doxxed, encountered and coerced into concluding the show and liberating the characters prematurely.</p>
<p>So here's the list of seasons I wrote.</p>
<p>(Warning: this is really, really long. It might just be what finally convinces me to add collapsion functionality to this page.)</p>
<ul>
  <li>Season 1: Happens like a standard soap opera, although now I've come back here and decided the person who will start to unravel the show's reality will be someone new in town, and essentially the decisive protagonist to most of the fanbase (at least as long as they're around). Around the middle of the season, someone will comment on something that seems to be a cliché trope in soap operas, but nobody will think too much about it. In the penultimate episode however, something dramatic will happen, and during an overdrawn suspenseful revelation, they'll remark saying that everyone should stop acting like ning-nongs and get to the point, and then just blurts out the point. At the end of the final episode, they'll mutter something along the lines of: "Why does everything feel so strange? This feels like a soap opera..."</li>
  <li>Season 2: They don't think much about it other than that it's strange, but eventually they do tell someone about what they've felt. It takes a while for the other person to really understand and believe them, and they're also interrupted, which only gives them more conviction that something really weird is happening. But it isn't long before the other person starts telling people about how the first person is starting to feel pretty strange - from both perspectives between them and the rest of the cast. They feel rejected, but quickly snap out of it and try to tell another person - who shortly decides they're a bit wacko. Now they start to feel a combination of desperation and rejection, but not much happens other than that.</li>
  <li>Season 3: Something shocking happens - something way too fitting for a soap opera, rather than reality - and it takes a while for the person to learn about it. They're still having the frustrations of slow-moving dialogue, almost blatantly inhibitory, but eventually they learn about it, and start trying to tell people on the internet about it toward the end of the season. This doesn't currently connect with reality, though.</li>
  <li>Season 4: They start trying to connect with the other people and really make the whole cast aware that something's definitely awry. At first, they're like, "wow, are you still on about that weird idea?"...but one other person starts to realise. They keep getting interrupted when they try to talk to each other alone, but get the chance once they're too suspicious. Eventually they mention superstition and that it might just be that reality is a really weird thing - but they agree to keep sharing their observations with each other.</li>
  <li>Season 5: Eventually, one of them starts doing research on soap operas and related tropes - and gets that feel like when you've just done a personality test/astrological assessment/whatever and are now reading remarkably accurate articles about your pathology and life. Now they are both adamant at least that their lives might be orchestrated in some way - not necessarily by authorship, but certainly manipulated to some degree nonetheless. They start becoming suspicious of the other characters, although they do try to keep making points - and this is when the show seems to take notice. The other characters start looking at them, almost invariably, like they're unhealthily obsessive, and they start developing feelings of isolation - but at least they have each other. The season finale ends with a breakup/falling-out with another character, making one/both of them feel...pretty sad. One other character starts being curious about why they feel that way so much.</li>
  <li>Season 6: This drives one of them to start doing research about theirself. Notice that they are using a made-up search engine that specifically excludes results about the show they're in, but they don't imagine this could actually be the case. This slowly progresses until the finale, with a lot of obstacles facing their personal life in the process, and eventually they finally come across a picture of theirself on the internet...over another person's name. The credits instantly transition from it in that way, showing other pictures of characters over actors' names.</li>
  <li>Season 7: At this point, the show banishes both of them under the explanation by other characters that they're caught-up in a silly conspiracy, and uses this time to introduce an old enemy of theirs (either from childhood or adulthood) into the cast. Once the enemy is properly friends with the main cast, finally in the finale, one of them shows up and makes a frantic, obviously drawn-out declaration that they are definitely, in fact, in a soap opera. A different actor is playing them, effectively overwriting everyone's memories of their appearance, but this transition is in vain. They would say it straight-up, but they realise they wouldn't be believed without quite a few lines of pre-explanation, and it reinforces their assimilation into a soap opera. The episode ends with the enemy walking into the room.</li>
  <li>Season 8: The first episode starts on some parts of storylines that aren't that, but quickly goes back to the revelation scene since it knows it can't hide it. The enemy is pretty much like, "long time no see... Looks like you've only started sucking more since we last saw each other. We're on a soap opera? Really??? Wow, you're pretty mental LOL." The person is like "no I have proof" but the enemy doesn't want to hear about it. In the next episode, the person tries to be more and more desperate so that the enemy's consistent stubbornness to not see the evidence proves their fabricated melodrama, but they just leave instead, with the person unable to do anything about it. They get as little screen time as they can get during the season, but eventually more people see the evidence, and this is when some of them start trying to contact people in the real world through various websites trying to make sense of the conundrum (although, as someone with more technological experience will note early in season 10, all of their devices have been blocked from accessing most sites mentioning the show, including almost every mainstream social platform). One or two characters die, and in the season finale they're all contemplating what to do about the situation.</li>
  <li>Season 9: At this point, the cast is very worried about what's happening. Problems seem to happen more frequently, and they're all trying to take steps to minimise the risks that would be imposed upon their lives since every little thing has arbitrary meaning while they all try to come up with a long-term plan to deal with the situation. They try to do things like be extremely upfront, minimise conflict, become friends, leave the show and be more diligent, but it's still very hard, and a lot of characters feel oppression and existential crisis. More family members and other characters with issues join the cast in an attempt to distract everyone from the reality of the situation, but this is also in vain as the main cast fills them in and reinforces the main problem. At the end of the season, a prominent character gets into serious trouble (with the law or a dodgy group of people), and another character sets out to research the producers.</li>
  <li>Season 10: Now the show is becoming very dramatic and violent. Characters are suddenly reminded of previous crimes they'd committed and other things they regret doing or ought to do, facing significantly more problems, and even dying more frequently. Someone notes that everyone's devices have been restricted, so they go to places like the local libraries and other places with devices...but they're all restricted as well, so they try to call family members overseas, telling them about their research so they can continue for them. As usual, it takes a long time to get through to them, and most of them still think they're crazy and don't bother to do any research, but a few believe them and start doing research...but one of them die as well. Which makes the relatives in the cast feel really guilty for dragging their distant family into this. It's now at this point that a few overseas characters start trying to talk to people in the real world through the internet, and a few sentiments are shared with the main cast. In the season finale, one of the characters snaps and runs outside, and many other characters chase them, forcing the show's footage to become akin to a frantic scene in a reality show with freehand cinematography. In exactly two simultaneous improvised takes, the character who ran outside starts yelling at people, desperately trying to spread the word about their situation, while the others follow them. Eventually, they see someone who may or may not know them as an actor or a character on the show, but tells them to stop harassing them and get that camera away from them. The character looks around, unable to see the camera, but they tell them to stop playing games and point at the camera. A lot of this might not happen, but the important thing is this: still unable to perceive the camera, the person runs toward the screen, looks indirectly at the viewer, and says something like, "are you there? Stop watching and HELP ME!" Then it cuts to black.</li>
  <li>Season 11: The first episode starts with the other characters chasing him for a while, but the cinematography is now steady again, indicating that the show is taking back control. They see him hit by a truck. Of course. The show is now flashing faint, subliminal messages on the screen such as "KEEP WATCHING", "THIS IS A GOOD SHOW", "THE UNCERTAINTY IS CAPTIVATING", "THIS IS WORTH WATCHING", "WE NEED MORE OF THIS" and "STAY WITH THE SHOW" multiple times per episode, particularly at the end of each one, and the soundtrack also has subliminal lyrics/voices similarly raving about the show. It also uses other propaganda and psychological techniques to simultaneously coax the viewers into watching the show and ignoring the problem. Now that some overseas family members have told them about the show, though, one character is soon caught for a crime and arrested, and they are all scheduled to go to court at a later date. At the moment, they're conflicted about whether they should keep trying to confront the producers, or attend the trial and present evidence about the actual show, but they soon decide on the latter. At the trial,</li>
  <li>Aaaaaaaand that's all he wrote. Muuuueeeeehhh.</li>
  <li>These HTML elements are a reference to an aunt.</li>
</ul>
<p>So here are some other more general ideas for this show:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If the show becomes an ARG, there will be a few main obstacles to overcome when trying to connect with the characters.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>One obstacle will be trying to locate the site. I suppose the actors would get to privately pick any sites of their choice, while the people running the show will try to find, shut down and derail all of their conversations. For more protection, they would have to try to use sites from the deep/dark web, minimise their involvement in the show, maybe use end-to-end encryption or archive methods, and all the rest of it.</li>
    <li>Another obstacle would be all the decoy roleplayers who'd inevitably appear. Many of them would be from the audience, and some might even be from the producers.</li>
    <li>Another obstacle would be all the people trying to shove the characters off-course by giving them false hope, information or promises.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Something about schizophrenia. I wrote this before an entry that says "court will not listen to show reality" so maybe that explains it</li>
  <li>"author tries to put in so much drama, show flops"</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Yeah not quite sure what I was thinking about there</li>
  </ul>
  <li>"eavesdropping on producer consulting psychologist and scriptwriters"</li>
  <li>"understanding author"</li>
  <li>Philosophical debate over what gives life purpose, the ethics of storywriting, authorship, godhood, subordination and determinism</li>
  <li>Eventual confrontation with this page and possibly the future r/CrazyIdeas post</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Truly_dynamic_music">Truly dynamic music</h3>
<p>I noticed that most examples of "dynamic music"...<em>aren't</em> particularly that dynamic. Like the majority of all the "dynamic" music there is consists of precomposed track layers that just crossfade into each other. The most dynamic examples of such music I've heard so far are in Baldi's Basics Classic Remastered, which includes midi tracks that can transpose and change tempo, and involve measure-snapped transitions, layer-fading and note sustenance in some parts, and 4D Golf, where they expand on the layer-fading idea and have multiple layers that accentuate or mute based on the realmic orientation, to subtly help trionian players navigate the place. In general, I find that scores for preproduced audiovisual media (like videos, movies, shows and animations), despite being comprehensively static, are far more "dynamic" than videogame OSTs have ever been from a musical standpoint. I mean, that makes them great for looping and listening to in the background, and not just having repetitive set story beats out of nowhere, but it's also a bit plain, and, decidedly unrevolutionary. :P</p>
<p>Well, this idea aims to produce a game that has truly dynamic music that musically reacts and adapts to your gameplay, like a film score does to the characters. The idea seems a bit like the speech of Squid, who reacts to pretty much everything you do in Will You Snail (so it's roughly as feasible), but in musical form. It doesn't have to be AI-generated, but the main point is to include melodies, leitmotifs, uhm, musical exclamations (yunno, like, the stings, probably), expectations and directions, tone/key shifts, and all the rest of it, with lots of variables controlling them all. And to make it even more interesting, make all of the soundtrack for the game microtonal on hardcore mode. Pulling off this idea would require decent proficiency in music theory, mixing and scorewriting. Unlike with the usual "dynamic" music, the game development and programming would have to directly involve the dynamics of musical theory and storytelling.</p>
<p>Probably the most important hallmark of dynamic music, which I honestly have not seen anyone do to a significant extent so far, is branch. All the dynamic music that exists so far has variations and things, but overall, it still has a linear progression. The closest I think I've heard is when a game cuts to one of multiple short codas, usually in response to a player succeeding or failing an objective, and honestly, that's not even really dynamic because there's no attempt to make the coda transition or blend in. It just cuts. Also, the game is basically a cutscene when said coda is playing. One of the most important parts of truly dynamic music, which would make it tedious or nigh-impossible to listen to as a linear soundtrack, would be adapting to branching player decisions, in realtime, with the music still following from before, and not just switching to another piece like pretty much every choice-based game ever.</p>
<p><!--Yeah, this would be even more involved than Lena Raine in Celeste.-->It would give everyone a unique experience of the soundtrack that's tailored to their gameplay. I'll know it turns out good if 1, the music sounds really good; 2, the music doesn't have a lot of bugs that make it sound unintentionally weird when the player does certain things; and 3, it's extremely hard to encapsulate the music in a linear soundtrack, and most attempts turn out to be disappointing. Videos about it would basically be like the ones showcasing different choices and endings in games, and it wouldn't result in a singular, cohesive soundtrack. Also, I kinda want to make this in Scratch, for two reasons. One: I want to see how well it'd function and perform on there, and it would be awesome if I got it to work well. Two: I think it would be funny if I did something revolutionary on Scratch and it ended up becoming just another featured project on there, with people all around pointing to a Scratch project as the origin of something revolutionary. What would be even funnier is if it was based on the Purple Nemesis saga. No considerable effort put into character design or anything like that: just funny balls and shapes doing a bare-bones conflict story, while the most epically satisfying music you can think of plays in the background reflecting the situation. It would be hilarious XDDDDD</p>
<p>Okay I just decided to do a Google search to see if there's some information about this, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_music">I saw the Wikipedia page about it</a> and it turns out that I'm not the first one to have this idea. LOL. Oh well! I hope I can at least be the first to do it in an orchestral style, with detailed pre-composed elements. And at least none of them involve player choice branching or elaborate recognition of player behaviour yet :P</p>

<h3 id="Immortality_story">Story about eternal immortality</h3>
<p>I think I got this idea a few months ago. It would be a story about someone who gets born, never dies, and slowly experiences a litany of increasingly-anomalous psychological effects as civilisation morphs and expands, the universe seems to shuffle itself around them, and it slowly drifts away from them as it dies, leaving them stuck floating in a silent void forever.</p>
<p>I think the first chapter would be about their development from birth to a century of age...</p>
<p>One of the major plot twists in the story is that it is an origin story for God - particularly, an Abrahamic-style interpretation of a monotheistic god with clear mental health issues. After floating in an empty vacuum for an increasingly googological span of time and constructing progressively more elaborate concepts in their head, the protagonist begins to start simulating universes in their mind with more and more complexity until finally, out of complete madness and desperation induced by an incomprehensible period of sensory deprivation, they imagine a universe in which they create a tiny speck bestowed with a thin layer of life, create chosen groups and torment them for a little while.</p>

<h3 id="Paranoia_game">A game about paranoia</h3>
<p>I had this idea many years ago. Dunno if I actually wrote it anywhere. I mean, I feel like I did, but I didn't see anything about it on my Reddit posts, my Reddit drafts or my Discord server</p>
<p>Basically, it's a game specifically engineered in such a way that anyone just popping by at any point in the game, like a roomie or a stream viewer, will <em>never</em> notice anything wrong immediately (unless you spoil it). In fact, it might even be designed to make you sound crazy if you try and frantically explain it, like you're most likely making things up about the game, or at the very least that there is some sort of problem, but <em>not now.</em> However, you will be freaking out and questioning everything a lot, and it will all make sense in context. Any other thoughts I had on this idea are probably lost to time</p>
<p>In case you're thinking - well, I was thinking that the game would be about more than just a mental illness or psychosis. There would be a lot of tangible elements - just ones hidden so well and reliant on context that uninformed people wouldn't notice. It would be a bit like the player and the game giving each other end-to-end encryption keys, but the keys are cues and associations and things</p>

  <li>Linguist/psychologist adventures meeting animals who are all able to speak specifically English but are perceived as only making miscellaneous noises, first realising that they're somehow able to coordinate in very specific ways while vocalising indiscernible content to each other, then doing sound recordings and spectral analysis, showing their findings to the animals, trying to figure out why they all have an up-to-date English library installed in their minds (despite not being constantly exposed to humans for many years like babies are, as well as some of them having more simplistic neurology), trying other methods of communication like typing and Morse code, questioning why only fiction writers seem to have noticed this all the way up until the modern era and carefully trying to reveal their findings</li>

<em><p>I'm not really into love but yeah, I came up with something crazy. Which turned out surprisingly long to type, but hey, accept the details. They're always important for...*checks thesaurus <s>and dies</s>* scientific people like us. Look, they're the kind from the SCP Foundation. Get that vibe.</p>
<p>First, choose something you want to promote, then pick an individual or anthropomorphic personification that represents it. I first assumed they had a first-sight mechanic (which obviously blind people would be immune to), so any sort of image that would cause psychological reaction correlating with facial semblance would probably work, depending on other arbitrary criteria which I don't want to get into at the moment (like stuff such as whether it only works with physical individuals, whether it works through webcams/photos, whether it has to be perceived as realistic, etc). Then I heard some love potions work based on additives from the target individual. In fact, that'd be easier in two ways: either you could add ANYTHING (sterilised) to it and make them attracted to any object associated with it, or you could at least be certain about the target individual. But you might have to choose a real-life person and depending on how you want to influence people, that might be yourself. Hide away.</p>
<p>Second, obtain love potion. Make sure it's concentrated (so as to have long-enough-lasting effects) and functions as mist just as effectively, and also that it's commitment-oriented rather than passion-oriented.</p>
<p>Yeah...only now is it occurring to all of us that they have different orientations on the triangular model of love...</p>
<p>Third, set up a large gathering of people, with a display screen somewhere at the front (if you're going to display a representation of an idea/promoted thing), and various canisters positioned around the place.</p>
<p>Now, really it depends on the potion but skip the following part if it isn't based on sight. Wait for them to be called to look at the screen/stage. Make sure the target's ready.</p>
<p>Then, activate the canisters. This should spray love potion in the air and affect everyone breathing it in.</p>
<p>If it's successful, all the attendees should now be lulled into following whatever silly propaganda you chose for them at the start. Representations work better, because they exist solely for the reason that they represent things, so obviously loving them would mean supporting the things they represent, but if you needed a real-life person, make sure loving them means the same thing.</p>

<!--<p>Yeah, it sounds like an absolutely ridiculous proposition. This system would theoretically create a much better society, but <strong>I don't advocate any actual attempts to realise it.</strong> Besides, one of the major obstacles for it being implemented in real life is societal inertia. Society already has terrible mental/sociological health and with all the existing defence of privacy, no way are people gonna support this enough for it to happen anyway. It's just one of those ideas that's so crazy, it just might work in theory - but it's still probably really crazy.</p>-->

<em><p>Shortly after birth, everyone gets implanted with recording equipment (parallel to their senses) that broadcasts everything they see and hear to an open-source streaming service 24/7. Anyone can go online and view it, skip through people's lifetime history and leave timestamps with titles/comments for easy reference. It would probably also support plugins, meaning you could get an AI to automatically caption/analyse people's streams, and then search their streams based on the captions and other relevant categories as well as the timestamps. Usually people would supervise and learn about other people by skipping through their streams and looking at the timestamps, as well as use it for free video calling.</p>
<p>Even though it's a ridiculously crazy idea, I actually have a case about why it would actually make a better society if it was in effect, and be almost impossible to abuse.</p>
