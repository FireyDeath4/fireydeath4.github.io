<h1><a href="/youtube-playlist-tools">YouTube Playlist Tools</a> - Privacy Policy</h1>
<h4 style="opacity:0.01">(It's mandatory, apparently. Or at least, so I think)</h4>
<p>I am not collecting user data at all. That is unless Google's scripts I added that are apparently required for accessing the YouTube API (which I don't even really understand) have something to do with it. And in that case you should take it up with Google, not me</p>
<p>Literally, all I am trying to do is access the YouTube API and plug it into an interface on a static site on Glitch so I can fetch data about playlists and do quick and convenient things to them that I can't do in YouTube <span style="opacity:0.5">(- at least, nearly as easily, since it can take hours to scroll through the whole playlist and drag and drop them and select them individually to do things with them, and that's when there's ONLY a few hundred items, but the thing about tags almost being impossible without creating multiple playlists for tags about single playlists. Which I would like to get around to deleting once I've made the tools and saved the playlists, because one day my account got terminated for apparently violating the policy on spams, scams and deceptive practices, even though I appealed and they said they realised my account didn't violate those policies after all, and in my appeal I said that if it had anything to do with my redundant playlists, I would delete them without question. And even though they didn't say anything about that, I kinda want to follow through with it in case it still is, and I want to have integrity).</span> Does that really have to be so hard?</p>
<p>I DO NOT WANT PEOPLE'S USER DATA. I WANT PLAYLISTS<br/>
\(-_-)/</p>
<p style="opacity:0.02">Do you want me to say anything specific?</p>
<p>Great, and now ChatGPT's just informed me that I don't even need to go through the whole OAuth thing if all I'm doing with the API is reading information rather than writing it</p>
<p>This is a stupid waste of time...</p>
