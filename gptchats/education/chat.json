You've touched on several interesting points about the education system, learning methodologies, and the potential for parallel learning. Here are some reactions and commentary:\n\n1. **Parallel Learning Concept:**\n   Your idea of teaching in parallel rather than in series is intriguing. The analogy to electrical circuits and the efficiency of parallel circuits compared to series circuits adds a unique perspective. It raises questions about the traditional linear progression in education and whether a more holistic, simultaneous approach could be more beneficial.\n\n2. **Early Learning Potential:**\n   Highlighting the early neuroplasticity of children and their potential to grasp complex concepts at a young age is a compelling argument. The comparison with TSC's rapid learning in Animation VS Math suggests that perhaps we underestimate the learning capacity of young minds.\n\n3. **Intellectual Challenge:**\n   Your observation about an aversion to intellectual challenge or stimulation is an interesting critique. It prompts consideration about the role of the education system in encouraging critical thinking, curiosity, and a love for learning.\n\n4. **Top-Down Learning Approach:**\n   The proposal for a top-down learning approach, where the ultimate goal is understood from the start and bottom-up learning is done in parallel, challenges the traditional bottom-up approach. It's a shift in perspective that could potentially allow students to explore and understand the broader context of subjects early on.\n\n5. **Integration of Concepts:**\n   The mention of ChatGPT's explanation of big boi integrals and the development of the math realm in Animation VS Math showcases the interconnectedness of concepts. It highlights the potential for integrating various subjects in a more cohesive manner.\n\n6. **Critique of Bureaucratic System:**\n   Your critique of bureaucratic systems and their focus on traditional, drawn-out curricula resonates with a broader conversation about the need for educational reform. It touches on the idea that these systems might not be fostering the full potential of individuals.\n\n7. **Humor and Expression:**\n   The use of emoticons and humor throughout adds a personal touch and makes the speech engaging. It helps convey your passion and frustration with the current state of education in a relatable way.\n\nOverall, your speech raises important questions about the efficiency and effectiveness of current educational practices and proposes an alternative perspective that encourages exploration and faster learning. It's evident that you've put a lot of thought into this topic!","id":"7cf97386-fe58-4ac1-85d5-bd96049e3254"},{"createTime":1702812028.910695,"type":"message","author":"user","text":"(Part 2)\n\nHere, you look\n&lt;image incompatible with GPT-3.5 model&gt;\nThat puts it all into effective perspective, doesn't it\n*scoff*\n*snoooooooooooort* ðŸ˜¹\nGosh\nI know this video [about biases] literally told me that egocentric bias includes a thing called false uniqueness bias, but god damn if nobody else got to come up with this stuff already\nYunno\nThe whole top-down idea is just another reflection of a principle I noted over a year ago in [my] server\n\n\"I noticed a lot of people do and support things because they're good, but then they eventually just do and support them because they're them, sentimentally familiar and traditional phenomena, without remembering precisely why and that they're good\nSo if they turn out to be not really that good, either because they weren't very good in the first place, or because they just got really popular or careless and started to soil, a lot of people are just ending up mindlessly committing to things because they already proved themselves even though things have clearly changed\nPeople seem to stick with things because they're good.

Here are some reactions and commentary on the second part:\n\n1. **Visual Perspective:**\n   Unfortunately, as a text-based model, I can't view images, but your statement about an image putting things into perspective suggests that you've used visual aids to support your arguments. Visual elements can indeed enhance understanding and drive home key points effectively.\n\n2. **Humor and Expression:**\n   The use of \"*scoff* *snoooooooooooort* ðŸ˜¹\" adds a touch of humor and lightness to your speech, making it more engaging and reflecting your emotional involvement in the topic.\n\n3. **Biases and False Uniqueness Bias:**\n   Connecting the top-down learning idea to biases, particularly false uniqueness bias, brings a psychological dimension to your argument. It emphasizes the importance of critically examining established ideas and practices to avoid blindly adhering to them.\n\n4. **Foundational Principle:**\n   The principle you articulated over a year ago about people supporting things because they're good, but eventually doing so out of familiarity and tradition, is thought-provoking. It's an insightful observation about human behavior and how sentiments can sometimes cloud judgment.\n\n5. **Manipulative Relationships Analogy:**\n   Drawing parallels between this principle and manipulative relationships adds a relatable context. It emphasizes the importance of critically assessing situations and not falling into patterns that might lead to detrimental outcomes.\n\n6. **Curricular Overhaul Idea:**\n   The notion of a curricular overhaul that could make people better at various aspects is intriguing. It aligns with the broader theme of rethinking traditional education models for more effective and meaningful learning experiences.\n\n7. **Concerns about Mainstream Education:**\n   Your concerns about mainstream education focusing on external rewards (like higher-esteemed simulacral letters) rather than intrinsic learning are shared by many. The disconnect between what students are taught and what they find useful in real life is a common critique of the education system.\n\n8. **Notable Quote and Foundation Erosion:**\n   The quote about judging things individually by their merit is powerful. Your observation about people focusing on things and gradually blurring out their foundations due to various factors like ADHD, other priorities, and a developing lack of care is a poignant reflection on societal thinking.\n\nYour speech is both insightful and reflective, touching on the complexities of education, human behavior, and the need for critical thinking.

One notable idea is the concept of \"Integrated Curriculum\" or \"Interdisciplinary Learning.\" This approach emphasizes the integration of multiple subjects or disciplines, encouraging students to make connections between different areas of knowledge.\n\nHistorically, educational philosophers like John Dewey have advocated for experiential and integrated learning, focusing on the interconnectedness of knowledge. More recent movements, such as project-based learning, also share some similarities with the notion of learning in parallel, as they often involve students working on multifaceted projects that encompass various skills and subjects.\n\nWhile these ideas may not perfectly align with your proposal, they share a common thread of moving away from isolated, compartmentalized learning.

While there might not be a single term that encapsulates the entire phenomenon you described, several concepts touch upon aspects of it:\n\n1. **Confirmation Bias:**\n   People tend to favor information that confirms their preexisting beliefs or values. Once something is established as \"good\" in their minds, they may actively seek information that supports this belief and ignore contradictory evidence.\n\n2. **Status Quo Bias:**\n   This bias refers to the preference for the current state of affairs. Once something becomes familiar and part of the status quo, there's a tendency to resist change, even if the original reasons for supporting it are no longer valid.\n\n3. **Sunk Cost Fallacy:**\n   The Sunk Cost Fallacy occurs when individuals continue investing in a decision or action based on what they have already invested, regardless of whether the investment is worthwhile. In the context you described, people might continue to support something because they have invested time or emotional energy in it.\n\n4. **Halo Effect:**\n   The Halo Effect is a cognitive bias where one positive trait influences a person's overall perception of an individual, group, brand, or product. Once something is perceived positively, this positive perception can spill over to other aspects, even if those aspects are not objectively positive.\n\n5. **Groupthink:**\n   In group situations, there's often a tendency to conform to group opinions or decisions without critically evaluating them. This can lead to a perpetuation of support for something without individuals questioning its merit.\n\nWhile there might not be a single term that perfectly encapsulates the entire phenomenon you described, these concepts collectively offer insights into why people might continue to support things without ongoing critical evaluation.","id":"3937db51-d9e7-4286-9779-416850336966"}]
