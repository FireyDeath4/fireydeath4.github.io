<h1>ANGER ~ Content Warning Inquiry</h1>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> Just don't tell people to go to Hell. That way, you won't have an integrous obligation to hurt people instead of crying when you realise either what you say you want them to go through, or that they won't go through it without worldly intervention. And, don't try and hurt people or we'll all get in trouble, which is hardly worth it for anybody.</p>
<p>If you're still not quite on board yet, see <a href="/gptchats/mistreatment">this conversation</a> for a more nuanced and benaligned take on handling misaligned agents that isn't just a pasted kinda-serious-but-rather-satirical rant followed by me having a chat about my emotions, and see <a href="/gptchats/pugnacity">this conversation</a> for some commentary on humanity's hostile disposition</p>
<p>Also you can just skip the speech message until I implement message grouping and collapse it by default</p>
<div id="chatgpt-conversation">Please wait (or enable JavaScript, or check the console if there's an issue)</div>
<p>I'll probably answer that and then update this conversation</p>
<p>I've got no idea why they made their app so convoluted when it really didn't have to be! I don't think I'd be able to share this even without the image when it seems like it may violate their usage policies, but apparently, sharing conversations with user uploaded images is not yet supported. And that's too bad, because it didn't take me long to add images to my chat recreation framework!</p>
<p>Eh, maybe they're still figuring out the safety and responsibility stuff :P</p>
