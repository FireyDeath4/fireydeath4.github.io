While it's true that the \"wooden case\" in the riddle does not directly apply to carbon dioxide, memories, or ideas, there are some other answers that could fit the riddle more closely.\n\nOne possible answer is a musical instrument such as a guitar or violin. The instrument is made from wood and is essentially a \"wooden case\" that contains strings that are never released, but are used by almost every person who plays music.\n\nAnother possible answer is a clock. Clocks often have a wooden case and are never \"released\" from that case, but are used by almost every person to keep track of time.\n\nAgain, I apologize for any confusion caused by my previous responses and I hope these new answers better fit the parameters of the riddle.","id":"74d40818-073f-407c-9508-8524c7277314"},{"createTime":1678904652.849281,"type":"message","author":"user","text":"Neither of those are mined.

Even though a secret is not a physical object, it is something that is used by almost every person in the sense that people often keep secrets and share them with others.","id":"f6daf2f3-fd08-4fdc-aec0-204dc39ade24"},{"createTime":1678904768.287831,"type":"message","author":"user","text":"How on earth would someone's mind qualify as a wooden case?
