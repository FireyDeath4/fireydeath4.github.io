<p>*<a href="https://bigfive-test.com/result/6796e441ea0c6987832d46c6">I just did a test on a site and got these results,</a> but I kinda don't really trust it, since the quiz made assumptions about what I do in life, what I'm able to do in life and how people's psychological frameworks operated, and it was hard to cross-reference questions since there were only three on the page at a time and I had to increment and decrement groups manually</p>
<p>**Results may be skewed by loaded questions, assumptions, ADHD, depression, and the current stagnating state of my life.</p>
<h2>Miscellaneous general facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I am a generalist, not an expert or a devotee in any singular topic of interest, and that makes it disincentivising for me to participate in topic-focused communities. (And it seems to me that <i>all</i> communities are based on at least some topic. I wonder, what kind of topic do you think I would generalise to?)</li>
  <li><span style="font-size:5px">Most of my cognitive power lies in gathering a large amount of perspectives and synthesising them regardless of categorisation.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>Physiology</h2>
<ul>
  <li></li>
</ul>
<h2>Interests</h2>
<h3>General</h3>

Comment readers:
I was gonna put this here originally but I decided against it for the time being, at least until I have other stuff on this page sorted out-->
<p>If you want to know more about me personally, <a href="/discord">look</a> at my Discord server. <a href="https://discord.com/invite/UYVyCSsb5T">(Or join it.)</a> I hope WidgetBot enables people to search and jump through messages at some point</p>
<p>WIP I didn't finish this page (as you can hopefully see from these photons forming pixels forming paths forming graphemes forming syllables forming words forming concepts forming phrases forming clauses forming sentences forming information)</p>
